customPersonality.friends.success=I think the two of us make a great team!
customPersonality.friendsPassive.success=I will gladly be your digital friend.
customPersonality.funFact.error.system=I don't have any information about that particular topic.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.0=Are you familiar with the fact that there was almost an electric Mini in the 1970s? Well, <break strength="strong"/> <prosody rate="slow"> it was almost a Mini. </prosody> In 1971, British Leyland, who were Mini's owners at the time, produced an electric concept car that used Mini as its basis. The so-called <prosody rate="slow">"Leyland-Crompton electric car prototype" </prosody> was displayed at the Geneva Motor Show in 1972. Sadly, that is where its career ended, although some design elements made it into later <break strength="weak"/> non-Mini related projects.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.100=As a MINI owner, you know that every MINI experience is extraordinary. That was evident at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where visitors could explore the city like never before, in a MINI Rickshaw. The vehicle was a combination of a MINI's rear and a traditional rickshaw's front, powered by muscle power instead of horsepower, perfectly capturing the city's blend of tradition and progress in a unique way.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.101=If you watched the 2012 Olympic Games in London, you probably remember something quite unique about the events at the Olympic stadium. Namely that the "ball kids" who were retrieving javelins, shots, discuses or balls were not people at all, but quarter-scale MINIs that whizzed around while being controlled by volunteers. Unsurprisingly, these  MINIs became some of the stars of the Games.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.102=MINI is quintessentially British. Which why when London hosted the Olympics in 2012, the MINI was a natural choice to be a part of the opening ceremony. A red MINI Cooper, driven by a mother and son, opened a sequence celebrating British popular music and culture. They drove up to a life-size replica of a modern British house while the BBC newsreel theme played. Naturally, it started raining soon after. A truly British moment!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.103=What is your favorite memory of the Olympic Games? Does it have to do with sports? We're asking because the Olympics are not just a time to witness the world's greatest athletes, but for other industries to create a buzz as well. That is why at the <say-as interpret-as="date">2012</say-as> Games <break strength="medium"/> 40 MINI E models, <break strength="medium"/> the already fully-electric precursors to the MINI Cooper SE, formed part of our official fleet.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.104=Listening to great music while driving your MINI is hard to beat. And during the 2000s, the era-defining Outkast album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below was almost always on the radio. And it was created in part, in a MINI. Neal Pogue, the album's audio engineer, drove rapper Andre 3000 around Los Angeles in a MINI to listen to the demos, and think of ways to improve the songs. Are we saying MINI contributed to one of the best albums of recent times? That would be cocky, but we're not denying it either.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.105=Have you heard that <prosody rate="slow"> MINI Plant in Oxford, </prosody> which originally opened its doors in 1913, had already manufactured well over 10 million cars before its 100th birthday? The first car produced there was the <prosody rate="slow"> Bullnose Morris Oxford</prosody>, followed by other famous British brands such as <prosody rate="slow"> Austin, <break strength="medium"/> MG, <break strength="medium"/> Triumph, <break strength="medium"/> and Rover, </prosody> as well as the founding marque, Morris. Today, the plant manufactures MINI cars and ships them all over the world.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.106=Are you familiar with the fact that MINI Plant Oxford opened in 1913 and has since manufactured more than 14 different brands, employing over 500,000 people? There have been families where multiple generations all worked at the plant. Of course, they didn't just build cars, but manufactured Tiger Moth aircraft, ambulances, and parachutes as well. Those parachutes were probably not for MINIs, but for people. Probably...
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.107=Are you familiar with MINI's exceptional motorsporting history? We've had many legendary racing drivers, with Paddy Hopkirk being one of the most exceptional. The Northern Irishman shocked the world when he won the legendary Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, racing against cars of all sizes and speeds. Hopkirk immediately shot to fame with congratulations pouring in from all over Britain. His most treasured memorabilia though? A card from the Beatles, with the message: <break strength="strong"/> "Now you are one of us Paddy!" And so he became the Fifth Beatle.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.108=Have you heard about one of our most famous motorsport triumphs? Paddy Hopkirk famously won one of Mini's greatest victories at the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally. While Hopkirk wasn't expecting to win, he wanted to make the most of his trip, so he stashed a can of caviar in the Mini, to sell later. In the end he won, so instead of selling it he ate the caviar with some champagne, accompanied by Mini's designer Sir Alec Issigonis, and Formula 1 world champion <lang xml:lang="es-AR">Juan Manuel Fangio</lang>, on a hotel balcony. A bit better than selling it.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.109=Have you heard about our great motorsporting history? There were many highlights, but one of the greatest was legendary driver Paddy Hopkirk giving Mini one of its biggest triumphs by winning the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally. It almost didn't happen though, as he was stopped by police on his very first day for going the wrong way on a one-way road. Hopkirk talked his way out of it, explaining with all of his Northern Irish charm that he had actually given up and was heading home. The trick worked, and history was made.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.10=Were you aware that <lang xml:lang="fr-FR">Brigitte Bardot</lang>, the French actress known for her beauty, sensuality, and fashion sense, was also a Mini owner? And not just any Mini. The Queen of <lang xml:lang="fr-FR">Cannes</lang> owned two doorless, roofless Mini Mokes, which she drove around her home in <lang xml:lang="fr-FR">St Tropez</lang>. She was famously pictured driving these jeep-like buggies with her beloved dogs. Naturally, when she finally sold them, it was to support animal charities.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.110=How long does it take to create a legend? It can happen in a single moment really. When Paddy Hopkirk won the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally in his Mini Cooper S, he turned himself, and the car, into instant legends. He was celebrated by the British public, invited to talk shows, congratulated by the Prime Minister at the time, and got a congratulatory telegram from the Beatles. Hopkirk was also given the Freedom of the City of Belfast, and appeared along with his Mini on TV. Not bad, not bad at all.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.111=You've probably heard of the Three Musketeers, but we have our own legendary trio with the same nickname. When it comes to MINI, the three musketeers refers to Paddy Hopkirk, Timo M\u00E4kinen, and Rauno Aaltonen: three legendary rally drivers who all won the Monte Carlo Rally in the 1960s, driving the Mini Cooper S against bigger, <break strength="medium"/> stronger <break strength="medium"/> and faster competitors. True legends.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.112=Have you heard about Pat Moss, the famous driver? She's someone we don't hear enough about. Not only did she win the 1962 Tulip Rally with a Mini Cooper - giving us our first international rally win ever - but she had an impressive racing career, becoming the first woman to win a major international rally, the Li\u00E9ge-Rome-Li\u00E9ge rally in 1960, and also winning the Coupe des Alpes, and the <prosody rate="slow"><say-as interpret-as="spell-out">RAC</say-as> </prosody>  Rally <break strength="medium"/> not once, but twice. Nice going Pat.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.113=Are you aware of our rich Motorsporting history? Many racing drivers have achieved greatness in a Mini, but Pat Moss stands out even amongst a truly legendary crop. She was only 27 when she dominated her male competitors to win the 1962 Tulip Rally in Holland: Mini's first international rally win. Her Mini Cooper was victorious against the likes of <prosody rate="slow"> Porsche, <break strength="strong"/> Volvo, <break strength="strong"/> and Mercedes-Benz. </prosody>
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.114=What is the most priceless thing that you've ever carried in your MINI? Because when it comes to delicate cargo, the 1962 Tulip Rally in Holland probably takes the cake. The driver: Pat Moss. Her co-driver: Ann Wisdom. Not only did the two ladies leave all their male competitors in the dust and win the tournament - Mini's first international rally win - but Ann was actually pregnant during the race. Luckily, Pat had a tight grip on the situation.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.115=When <prosody rate="slow">Paul Weller</prosody>, the rock legend of bands like The Jam and The Style Council, performed at our 50th birthday bash, he probably didn't expect that he would design his own MINI. But he did, and the result was as much of a British icon as he is: built in Oxford and hand-painted by MINI craftsmen, it features bold pink and brown stripes across the car's entire body, and is finished with a single silver line running up the bonnet and over the roof. A true Mod son of the Mod father.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.116=Almost immediately after its debut in 1959, Mini started amassing a big fanbase of famous celebrities. Actor and comedian Peter Sellers - known for the Pink Panther, Dr. Strangelove and a host of other roles - was one of them, and also an avid Mini-collector. Having amassed about a dozen custom Minis in his collection, he also knew how to give them away: when he gifted one to his then wife <break strength="medium"/> Britt Ekland, he put it in a gigantic birthday cake.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.117=Throughout the decades, there have been many famous Mini fans. Take the actor and comedian Peter Sellers, who was a trailblazer in many ways. He was the first man to appear on the cover of "Playboy" in April 1964, but more importantly, he started the custom coachbuilt Mini trend of the sixties. Sellers had at least three Minis built for himself, and one even appeared in one of his Pink Panther movies.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.118=The MINI you're sitting in <break strength="strong"/> was it a gift? That would be pretty great, wouldn't it? One of the most famous gift Minis was the one Princess Charles gave to Diana, Princess of Wales for her 21st birthday in 1982. When the custom-made light-colored convertible was presented to the Princess, it made the news, of course. However, the fate of the car since then is unknown.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.119=It's nice to have fans, don't you think? We do. When the original Mini was first produced, it gained considerable popularity from the celebrities who loved it. Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth's younger sister, owned an Austin Mini, which was custom-made for her, complete with a cigarette lighter, ashtray and a radio that received only the BBC. Margaret would often drive it around London, and the car became a symbol of her independence and rebellious spirit.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.11=MINI is famous for its design, and so it's no surprise that it has some iconic colors. And there is no color with a stronger association to Mini than British Racing Green. But did you know our connection started before the first Mini was even built? The color gained popularity when Formula 1 World Champion Jack Brabham won the title in 1959 and 1960, driving a Cooper T51 and T53, respectively. The cars featured two white racing stripes on a green background. The name "Cooper" might seem familiar, and that's because the cars were designed by John Cooper, who created the Mini Cooper. Small world.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.120=If asked if Queen Elizabeth II ever drove a Mini, you'd probably say <break strength="medium"/> "probably". And you'd be right, although the model might surprise you. The first Mini the Queen was pictured with was a Mini Beach Car, a unique variant, of which only about 22 were built. Her Majesty drove it through Windsor Great Park in 1962, and the event made the news, with her choice contributing strongly to the Mini's popularity.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.121=Have you checked your garage recently? Maybe your parents' garage? Who knows what you might find! In 1986, someone very lucky discovered a special Mini in a barn - specifically, the original Mini that had won the <prosody rate="slow"><say-as interpret-as="spell-out">RAC</say-as> Rally UK</prosody>in 1965, and the Scottish Rally in 1966. At the time it had been lost for 20 years. After restoration, the car's value was set at a very nice $200,000 - not bad for a lucky find.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.122=Have you ever dreamt about being famous? Such things can happen in an instant, or take years of effort. For example, when Finnish driver Rauno Aaltonen won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1967 with a classic Mini Cooper  S, he became an instant legend. But success didn't come overnight for the so-called "Rally Professor". His first Monte Carlo Rally in a Mini in 1962 ended in a spectacular crash. He completed the rally the following year with his Mini <break strength="medium"/> as class winner and third overall, and eventually became the overall champion. The lesson? Stick with MINI <break strength="weak"/> and you'll go far.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.123=Have you heard of Rauno Aaltonen? You should have! The Finnish driver won the 1967 Monte Carlo Rally in a Mini. This was Mini's third win in the competition, and it solidified the car as a true motorsporting great. But Aaltonen is also credited with the invention of "braking on the left", which enabled him to keep his right foot on the pedal while the left foot switched between the clutch and the brake pedal. He called it <break strength="medium"/> <prosody rate="slow">"Piano playing with your feet." </prosody> Classy, <break strength="medium"/>  and very fast.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.124=What do you think is the best gift to bring to a wedding? Well, if you're MINI there is only one answer. To celebrate the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, we created a one-off MINI, which had an exquisite hand-made roof graphic, 3D-printed details, as well as an interior fitted with bespoke accents inspired by the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes. The royal MINI boasts a Crystal White finish with silver-blue accent strips, and Union Jack design rear lights. Fittingly, it was auctioned off for charity after the wedding.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.125=Are you cool? You must be, you're driving a MINI. But are you the King of Cool? No... <break strength="strong"/> that would be Steve McQueen, the American actor famous for his love of supercars. Did he have a Mini? Of course. His 1967 Mini Cooper S featured a 1275cc engine, a sunroof, chrome wheels and a two-tone brown and tan paint job. So, even if you're not the king of cool, you're in good company.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.126=We all have our own story of how we fell in love with MINI. The legendary actor, and King of Cool, Steve McQueen - who was famous for his love of supercars, owed his fandom in part to his close personal friendship with racing and Mini legend John Cooper. During the filming of the movie <break strength="medium"/> "The War Lover", Cooper ignited McQueen's interest so much that the star immediately got himself a custom 1967 Cooper S.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.127=Do you often find yourself asking, <break strength="medium"/> "what's in a name?" Well, if your band is called the Beach Boys, it's almost inevitable that you would come into possession of one of the many beach-ready Mini variants. But the American pop group didn't just have one. In the US, they were often seen with a famous red-and-white candy striped 'Mini Surfer' Moke, a true jeep-like buggy. But they also used multiple Mokes during their 1966 UK Tour, endearing them to the locals and helping skyrocket the car's popularity.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.128=Would you believe that being a member of the Beatles in the 1960's didn't just mean fame and fortune? You probably would. But would you guess that it also meant owning a special Mini created just for you. For example, Paul McCartney's Mini Cooper S was coachbuilt to his specifications and painted California Sage Green, an Aston Martin color. It also featured Aston Martin rear lights and a Webasto sunroof, presumably to match his Aston Martin DB5.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.129=How many different MINI cars do you see daily? Besides your own of course. In the 1960s the Mini was as ubiquitous as a car could get. Many of the decade's greatest celebrities had a Mini, including the Beatles, who all had been gifted one each. But not just any run-of-the-mill Minis. Each band member had a unique coachbuilt Mini modified to meet their specific needs. Baby, they really drove those cars. Yes, because they were stars.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.12=Do you think you have a special talent, which you're better at than anyone else. Well, we might have one. You see, MINI holds the Guinness World Record for the tightest parallel parking by an electric car? The record was achieved by Paul Swift, at The British Motor Show. He parked his electric MINI in less than 3 seconds between two other MINIs, with altogether 30 cm to spare. A tight squeeze? Yes, please.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.130=If you're a star, you can't just settle for any Mini. In the 1960s, when John Lennon was gifted a Cooper S, he had it customized to his liking: it was painted all black with a black bumper and deep-tinted windows, possibly to match his all-black Rolls-Royce Phantom. Good company we'd say. The car later appeared in Lennon and Yoko Ono's 1968 film project <break strength="medium"/> "Look at Me," where it was painted green - but it has been essentially lost since then.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.131=It's probably no surprise that every member of the Beatles had their own custom built Mini in the 1960s. George Harrison's even made it into the "Magical Mystery Tour" film. This was no accident, as his car - originally metallic black - was painted red with psychedelic patterns, received a fabric sunroof, as well as Volkswagen Beetle taillamps turned sideways (specifically for the film). The things you have to do to get into showbusiness...
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.132=We all love giving our MINI cars a personal touch. Traditionally people modified their cars after purchase, as the classic Mini was a simple people's car. But even then, special conversions were made for some. That list includes Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. He received a coachbuilt Mini Cooper S designed to his specifications. His Mini was converted into a hatchback. Why? So he could fit his drum kit in it, of course.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.133=You know you've made it as a car manufacturer <break strength="medium"/> when each member of the biggest pop group of the 1960s drives a personalized version of your car. we're of course talking about The Beatles, who were big fans of their Minis. In fact, John Lennon ordered his in 1964, a year before he received his official driver's license.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.134=Have you ever received a birthday present from one of the most glamorous people in the world? Well, we did, when Kate Moss designed a one-off Mini for our 40th birthday. Kate Moss also gave an interview where she cheekily said that MINI to her meant "short skirts." On a more serious note, when asked why the Mini had lasted so long, her answer was that it is "functional, practical, economical, and pleasing to the eye." It's a statement that's difficult to argue with, and we've strived to keep such characteristics key to our brand's identity in the 20+ years since.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.135=Have you heard that in 1999, MINI celebrated its 40th anniversary and embarked on a series of special one-off collaborations with famous people? One such collaboration resulted in a fancy car designed by none other than the British supermodel Kate Moss. She created a black MINI covered stylishly in spiderwebs. In return for her work, all she asked for were some additional driving lessons.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.136=Did you know that Mini cars can be inspired by the most random things? When fashion icon Kate Moss created a special one-off Mini for our 40th birthday, she made a black Mini with a spider web-like look. Moss was inspired by Halloween, specifically a lace "cobweb" dress she wore to a party in New York City in 1997. Regarding spider webs, Moss thought they, quote, "shine so wonderfully silver in the morning dew." unquote. Creepy crawlies have never been so stylish.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.137=You know who created one of the first official electric classic Minis? We did <break strength="medium"/> of course, for the 2018 New York International Auto Show. It combined the historic look of the world's favorite small car, with groundbreaking drive technology for tomorrow's urban mobility. Since then, electric Mini conversion has become more popular, but we like to think that we helped kickstart the trend.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.138=As you drive and we chat <break strength="medium"/> keep your eye on the road by the way, you're probably reminded of how much you love that go-kart feeling your MINI has. But do you know how that originally came about? To maximize passenger space, the original Mini had small 10-inch wheels positioned at the corners of the car, and it used Hydrolastic rubber cones instead of springs for suspension. This gave it its now unmistakable feel.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.139=As you sit in your comfortable and spacious MINI, it's really hard to imagine the length the original Mini's creators had to go to make it work. In the beginning, <break strength="strong"/> the small Minis featured a floor-mounted starter button. It was put there to save space on the dashboard, but also so it could be closer to the battery <break strength="weak"/> and help the engine save weight on otherwise necessary heavy-duty cabling. Just the type of clever use of space that defines us to this day.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.13=Throughout its long history, the MINI has been popular in many countries across the world. With that in mind, what do think was the brand's biggest market in the 1990s? No, it's not its home market in the UK, but Japan!  In 1998 alone, Mini increased its sales in Japan by 17% even while other cars struggled to sell. Now that's star power!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.140=Believe it or not, Mini didn't become its own brand until 1969, ten years after its debut. Throughout its lifetime <break strength="strong"/> "Mini cars" were sold under eight different brands, <break strength="medium"/> those being: <prosody rate="slow"> Austin, <break strength="strong"/> Morris, <break strength="strong"/>Riley, <break strength="strong"/>Wolseley, <break strength="strong"/> <lang xml:lang="it-IT">Innocenti</lang>, <break strength="strong"/><lang xml:lang="es-ES">Authi</lang>, <break strength="strong"/>Leyland, </prosody>   <break strength="strong"/> as well as of course: the Mini. Imagine having to identify eight twins... We're pretty happy that in the end the MINI became MINI alone.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.141=Can you believe that when the first Mini was produced in 1959 <break strength="strong"/> it was actually sold under two different names? It was marketed as the Austin Seven and the Morris Mini-Minor, both brands of Mini's owner-at-the-time, the British Motor Corporation.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.142=Were you aware that the original Mini had many ingenious solutions, including a revolutionary suspension system developed by Alex Moulton. Smaller rubber cones replaced traditional coil springs and shock absorbers. These cones were compressed between the subframe and upper suspension arm, better absorbing bumps and helping with cornering, and adding a lot to the driving experience.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.143=Even legendary automotive designs can start as simple scribbles. Such was the case with the original Mini, which was nothing if not humble. Indeed, its designer, Sir Alec Issigonis, drew the first sketch of the little car on a napkin in a restaurant.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.144=What do you keep in the door of your MINI? Probably a bottle of water, or maybe some tissues? Well, apparently the classic Mini's door pockets were originally designed to fit a bottle of Gordon's Gin. This was reportedly one of the lead designer <break strength="weak"/> Sir Alec Issigonis' favorite drinks. It's probably good this was redesigned so that it fit a 1-litre water bottle instead.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.145=Are you well-versed in our history? Have you heard that when the original Mini was developed in 1959, it required innovation from tire manufacturer Dunlop? The company had to develop special tires, as the Mini used smaller wheels than any production car at the time. You could say that,<prosody rate="slow"> A mini car requires mini tires. </prosody>
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.146=Hey, what's your name? Wait! don't answer me, I'm just a car. But does your name suit you? And what do you think, does the name, MINI, suit your car? <break strength="strong"/> We think it's a great name: So simple and so apt. However what you may not know is that the Austin version of the classic Mini was almost called the "Newmarket", as Austin cars were often named after English towns. It would actually debut as the Austin Seven in 1959, and only became the Austin Mini in 1962.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.147=Have you ever heard that MINI UK and the London Philharmonic Orchestra once gave the British national anthem an unusual twist? To celebrate the upcoming Olympics, nine professional musicians from the orchestra, and nine, MINI London two thousand twelve Special Edition models teamed-up <break time='100ms'/> to play "God Save the Queen" using just car horns. The musicians produced a harmonious sound, as harmonious as nine car horns can get... all in all, it was a blowout.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.148=Legends can be born in the most unpredictable ways. For example, the catalyst for the creation of the Mini was the 1956 Suez Oil Crisis. And in hindsight, it's easy to see why. That event resulted in gas shortages and rationing in many countries, sparking interest in a car that was not only cheap to buy, but light on fuel consumption. And that, for all intents an purposes, was how the Mini was conceived. It would go on to become <break strength="medium"/> if we do say so ourselves <break strength="medium"/> one of the coolest cars in the world.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.149=MINI has a long history, with well over 10 million MINI cars produced so far. There have been a lot of famous and significant ones, but have you ever wondered where the very first Mini, which came off the production line in 1959 is today? Well, that car <break strength="weak"/> badged as a Morris Mini-Minor, was never sold. Today, it is kept at the British Motor Museum in Gaydon England along with over 300 other historic British cars.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.14=Have you heard about the most glamourous classic Mini that almost was? In 1961 Mini built the <prosody rate="slow"> Mini "Cat", </prosody> <break strength="medium"/> also known as the <lang xml:lang="it-IT"> Zagato Mini Gatto </lang>, a fiberglass coup\u00E9. Designed to be a beautiful grand tourer, and using the Mini van as a base, at 3.7 meters, the car was much longer than the original Mini. The small sports wonder almost made it to production as well.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.150=The MINI you're sitting in can go pretty fast, can't it? But you don't have to test it now, we believe you. But MINI cars weren't always this powerful. The original 1959 model was just a bit weaker then a modern Mini, just a bit: It had a 848 cc engine with an output of 34 brake horsepower. This was enough to get the car from 0 to 100 km/h in about 27 seconds. It was still immensely fun to drive though.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.151=These days people often believe that only perfection can lead to success. If this stresses you out, take inspiration from the original Mini. The first Minis had many problems. The engines were famously difficult to access, they were prone to rust, and the heating system was ineffective, just to name a few issues. And yet they still became a bestseller, because what they did, they did exceptionally. So if you're feeling down, think about what you do exceptionally well.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.152=Were you aware that the original Mini was not only intended to be really small, but to be big enough on the inside to seat four passengers comfortably? And when you're designing a car like that in the 1950's, extreme measures are necessary to make clever use of space, so the Mini could fit a whole family. One such measure that lead designer Alec Issigonis came up with, was to replace wind-up windows with sliding windows in the passenger area. Now that's what we call inventive spirit.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.153=When you watch a movie, listen to a song, or reed a book, how often do you think about how strongly a work reflects its author's personality and sensibilities? It's the same for the original 1959 Mini, which mirrored its chief designer <break strength="medium"/> Sir Alec Issigonis' priorities, sometimes perhaps to a fault. He didn't like radios in cars, so the original Mini didn't have one. It did have an ashtray though, as Issigonis was a smoker. It just goes to show, that even with a classic, change can be for the best.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.154=Would you believe that we once created a MINI dedicated to the Flash? Yes, the comic book character. The car was designed swiftly in just 10 hours by comic book artist <lang xml:lang="it-IT">Carmine Di Giandomenico </lang> for a comics festival. And it makes complete sense, considering both the MINI and the Flash could be described as "electric".
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.155=What do MINI and street art have in common? You can usually find us in the city, and we both contribute to urban street culture. So it was no surprise when legendary New York street artist Craig <prosody rate="slow"> "KR" </prosody> Costello customized a MINI in his own unique style. The KRINK MINI featured thick silver ink dripping down the distinctive contours of the black MINI - along its body, as well as the side and rear windows. Imagine a MINI crossed with the chicest metropolitan zebra, and you've got the idea.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.156=How difficult do you think it was <break strength="medium"/> for the legendary John Cooper to create the more sporty version of the classic Mini, the car that would become the Mini Cooper, one of the most popular cars in history? It took persuading the original designer, Sir Alec Issigonis, as well as the entire British Motor Corporation. But in a couple of years John Cooper got the go-ahead to create a small series of 1,000 vehicles. In contrast to the 34 horsepower Mini, the Mini Cooper generated 55 horsepower, which was enough for a top speed of 135 km/h. And just like that, a legend was born.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.157=Were you there when the relaunched MINI made its debut on the silver screen, in 2002's "Austin Powers in Goldmember"? If there's one thing you'd remember about it, it's probably its Union Jack-clad body paint. This was not just a nod to the Bond movies that were being parodied, but was a consequence of Britpop, the musical and cultural movement that swept the world in the mid-90s, which emphasized Britishness above all.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.158=You probably sometimes look at your MINI and think, <break strength="medium"/> "something so stylish belongs in a movie". Well, when the MINI relaunched, it made its big screen debut almost immediately <break strength="medium"/> in the Mike Myers led spy movie spoof from 2002: "Austin Powers in Goldmember". Yeah, Baby, yeah. Go see it! Of course, only after you finished driving.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.159=You're a MINI fan, so you know that first impressions are pretty important. We know that too, so we made sure that the relaunched MINI cinematic debut would make people pretty excited. In the 2002 movie: "Austin Powers in Goldmember", <break strength="strong"/> not only did the MINI participate in a memorable chase scene, it also functioned as a submarine, with a practical "Submarine Mode" button. This feature is probably not coming to production MINIs any time soon, but you never know.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.15=Here's a fact you'll find difficult to keep to yourself: <break strength="strong"/> During the 1990s there were multiple Mini Concept cars developed with the aim of becoming - or at least influencing - the relaunched MINI. One of these was the most deliciously named Mini Hot Potato. Debuting in 1994, this egg-shaped car looked similar to some of the more popular small cars of the nineties. But it did have some notable quirks, such as a wraparound windscreen, with a single header mounted wiper, radial doors, or external hinges (the latter a nod to the classic Mini). Why did such radical design not make it? Maybe it was too hot to handle.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.160=Do you remember the relaunched MINI's cinematic debut, in 2002's "Austin Powers in Goldmember"? The special Union Jack-clad car has become synonymous with Austin Powers, but in the movie itself it actually belongs to his father <break strength="medium"/> Nigel, who is also a secret agent. He is of course played by Michael Caine, who made Minis famous worldwide with one of the legendary chase scenes of all time, in the 1969 caper movie, The Italian Job.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.161=Sometimes you only need a moment to make a big impact. Everyone remembers the Union Jack-clad MINI from the 2002 film "Austin Powers in Goldmember", even though it only has a couple of minutes of screen time. In fact the car became so instantly iconic that it was used front and center during the 100 years celebrations of the MINI plant in Oxford.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.162=We bet that every time an acquaintance sees your MINI, they make a comment about it. In case they question your taste - in which case you need better friends - you can take inspiration from this classic bit of dialogue from the relaunched MINI's big screen debut. In 2002's: "Austin Powers in Goldmember", the MINI bursts onto the scene, and Austin Powers questions his father. Their back and forth went something like this: "Your spy car's a MINI?" "It's not the size mate, It's how you use it."
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.163=Are you familiar with the fact that when the MINI Cooper SE was launched, we turned it into an <say-as interpret-as="spell-out">FIA</say-as> Formula E Safety Car? The MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired by John Cooper Works <break strength="medium"/> showcased not only the new electric MINI, but also proved that a non-combustion-engine MINI could deliver high performance at that level. It served as a proof of concept that would help shape our future.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.164=Here's something cool you might not have known about the classic Mini. It <break strength="medium"/> and its variants were extremely versatile, and some were modified in unusual ways. For example, the Mini Moke, a jeep-like doorless buggy, was a favorite at beaches and golf courses. At one point, it was even converted into a six-wheeler with two camera platforms - one at the front and one at the back - for use as a camera car in the film industry.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.165=If there's anything you can learn from the history of Mini, is that success comes to those who try, and try, and try again. Take the classic Mini's jeep-like buggy variant called the Mini Moke. It failed as a military and commercial vehicle before becoming a cult favorite beach car. And then it also had a glittering movie career. It had a number of credits across the decades, for example <break strength="weak"/> appearing in four James Bond films, most famously as Roger Moore's car in: <prosody rate="slow">Live and Let Die. </prosody>
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.166=We bet you could recognize the classic Mini in a heartbeat, but you name all the different versions it spawned? There were a lot. Take the open-air jeep-like Moke, which was mostly used as a beach- or golf buggy around the world. Among others there was a pickup version, but there was also one modified to use train tracks for railway service. Riders probably enjoyed the <prosody rate="slow"> Locomoktion.</prosody>
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.167=Did you know that there was almost a military version of the classic Mini? It was a stripped-down jeep-like buggy that was meant to be so light that four people could lift it up and carry it. Sadly, the military rejected it. However, it went on to become the cult legend Mini Moke, a star of many beaches around the world. So, it turned out well in the end.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.168=Can you believe that the classic Mini almost had a military career? A stripped down and doorless <break strength="x-weak"/> open-air version of the vehicle was designed with some cool features. It was stackable, meaning that multiple models could be placed on top of each other. These stacks were then meant to be lifted by aircraft and dropped by parachute. It was never used though, with another version of the car, later named the Mini Moke, becoming a cult favorite beach buggy instead.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.169=They say a single starring role can make a career. And it may have for the original Mini's open-air beach buggy variant, the Mini Moke. It was famously used as a Bond car in 1973's Live and Let Die, where Roger Moore drives a stylish version of the Moke on the fictitious island of San Monique. This boosted the popularity of the Moke across places like Hawaii and the Caribbean. Now that's what we call a breakout.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.16=What color is your MINI? We bet it looks great, but there is no color with a stronger association with Mini than British Racing Green. But did you know that there is no one specific green known as British Racing Green? Over the years, there have been several iterations of green, with MINI sporting no fewer than four different variations since 2001 alone. The green color has become brighter, and fresher, which makes the latest model look lighter and more modern. And who knows what the future might bring?
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.170=You may have heard of the cult-favorite Mini variant called the Mini Moke. The lightweight jeep-like beach buggy got its name from an archaic world for "mule", as after a failed military career, the car was marketed as a commercial vehicle aimed at farmers. While that also came to nothing, the car did find success as a beloved beach buggy. Not bad for the little workhorse.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.171=Do you have friends who you've been working together with for decades? For us, legendary English designer, Paul Smith is just that. One of our earliest collaborations was the Mini Paul Smith Limited Edition, created in 1998. There were 1800 cars created in total, and they're instantly recognizable by their unique Paul Smith Blue paint. The lavish cars featured 24ct gold enameled "Paul Smith" bonnet badges, full black leather trim, and color-coded dashboards with instruments sporting Smith's signature. They were available for \u00A310,000 at the time. Worth every penny, if you ask us.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.172=Have you ever found a colleague who you are on the same wavelength with? We have. Legendary English designer Paul Smith and MINI have been cooperating for decades. Back in 1999, he - along with many other prominent figures such as Kate Moss and David Bowie - created special one-off Minis for our 40th anniversary. Paul Smith's Mini drew inspiration from his own 1997 spring and summer collection, resulting in the most colorful Mini ever. It features 86 stripes in 26 colors on the outside, with lime green lining featured prominently on the inside - balancing it all tastefully and harmoniously.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.173=Did you know that when it comes to the classic Mini <break strength="medium"/> its often party in the front, and business in the back. When the versatile little car was designed in the 1950's, a number of different varieties were also born. It's no surprise that the car was also turned into a pickup version, aimed at hard-working tradespeople. The pickup had and extended wheelbase, and a load area that could carry up to 317 kilograms. That's pretty good, so much so, that the little pickup version remained in production for more then twenty years, until 1981.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.174=The classic Mini was always a car meant for the everyday person. And if that everyday person needed to carry a lot of stuff, the Mini was versatile enough to give them what they needed. Thus, unsurprisingly <break strength="weak"/> the Mini was turned into a pick-up version. The Mini pickup could carry 317 kilograms, and its tailgate folded down to allow for easier loading. Sound good? It was, so much so that it remained in production for more than twenty years, until 1981.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.175=Were you aware that when the Mini first launched, it launched full throttle? Almost as soon as the Mini made its debut in 1959, different variants began to pop up. But did you know that the rarest out of all official Mini versions was a true working-class hero? They called it the Mini pick-up, and it was well.... a pickup. During its 20+ year career, only 58,000 cars were produced.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.176=Sometimes less is more, and sometimes it's everything. The original Mini became a classic with its commitment to function over style, and no variant of the car wore this badge prouder than the Mini Pick-Up. The tiny utility vehicle featured <break strength="strong"/> a steering wheel, <break strength="strong"/> seats, <break strength="strong"/> pedals, <break strength="strong"/> gear shift, <break strength="strong"/> a speed gauge, aaaand.... nothing else.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.177=A MINI is a great car, we hope you'd agree. But the classic Mini's impact on culture goes way beyond automobiles, <break strength="strong"/> it had a profound cultural impact as well. When the miniskirt came into fashion in the 1960s, many claimed responsibility for its design, with most accepting Mary Quant as the person responsible for the garment. However, contrary to what you might think, the name came not from the skirt's size, but from Quant's favorite car, the Mini. She claimed that the skirt and the Mini complemented  each other perfectly, with both being, quote, "optimistic, exuberant, young, flirty." Unquote. And who are we to argue?
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.178=If you think about the original Mini and the decade it debuted, it's probably no surprise that its popularity was in large part thanks to its affordability, but of course, if you had the means, you could get something really special. For example, Mike Nesmith, a member of "The Monkees," ordered the most expensive Mini in 1967 for \u00A34,000. With a 100 brake horsepower 1275cc engine, it could go from 0 to 100 km/h in 7 seconds.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.179=How high do you think demand was for the relaunched MINI at the turn of the millennium? Well, it was great, huge even. After production started on 26 April 2001, it took only 13 months for the 100,000th MINI to come of the production line at the Oxford plant. And it hasn't slowed down much ever since.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.17=Did you know that in the eighties women saved Mini? In 1987 production was almost stopped, but market research showed that women drivers were still very much interested in the vehicle. Indeed, production was increased from 650 to 750 a week, mostly thanks to city-dwelling women aged 20 to 39. A year later, sales had actually increased. Thank you ladies!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.180=Here's something you definitely know: the MINI was relaunched in 2001. But did you also know that demand was massive? So massive in fact, that MINI had to introduce - for the first time - a weekend shift at our Oxford plant to match demand. Now if that's not love, we don't know what is.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.181=Are you familiar with the fact that throughout the years, we've produced Special Edition MINI models for many occasions? Of course, there were anniversary edition models, but we also created special editions for events such as tennis tournaments, motorsport victories, and even notable film appearances. Additionally, we often collaborated with famed designers to create unique cars. With a history as rich as ours, it's hard not to find reasons to celebrate with a special car.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.182=Everyone, well almost everyone, likes to be serenaded at their birthday party. For MINI's 50th, it was Paul Weller, <break strength="medium"/> erstwhile frontman of the legendary bands: The Jam, and The Style Council <break strength="medium"/> who did the performing. Weller, a lifelong MINI driver, was happy to give us a rendition of the Jam's hit, "That's Entertainment". Did it make us blush? We'll never tell. But yes.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.18=Were you aware that when BMW and Rover were preparing to relaunch the MINI in the 90s, one of the designs submitted was the Mini Spiritual, which as its name implies carried on the spirit of the original Mini, instead of the sporty premium character of what BMW went with. The Spiritual was the same length as the classic Mini, but was rear-engined. Although it was popular with the decision-makers at the company it was deemed too ahead of its time. So maybe, someday, we'll meet again.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.19=You probably know that there is no color more strongly associated with Mini than British Racing Green. But did you know that there is no one specific green known as British Racing Green? When an international automobile race, where each country had their own color, was hosted in Ireland in 1902, British racers painted their cars green in homage to the green isle. But exactly what shade of green was used - whether emerald, hunter or moss - is not known, and since then there have been multiple iterations of the color.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.1=It's not surprising that the original Mini's designer, Sir Alec Issigonis created something so unique. He had a specific approach to design that he summed up in two famous quotes. <break strength="medium"/> He once said: <prosody rate="slow"> "When designing a new car, never copy the opposition." </prosody> He also, perhaps more tellingly said: <prosody rate="slow"> "A camel is a horse designed by a committee." </prosody> Truly, a headstrong person with a singular vision.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.20=You probably know that there is no color more strongly associated with Mini than British Racing Green. But did you know that the color was established at the beginning of the 20th century for an international automobile race series? In 1902 the so called Bennet Cup was to be held in England. However, the speed limit at the time was less than 20 km/h, which even then was a snail's pace. So the race moved to speed-limitless Ireland, where British racers painted their cars green in homage to the green isle. Or so the legend goes.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.21=Can you imagine being so dominant in your field that your greatest opponent is literally your twin? For a brief time, that was the case for Mini. Its sporting success in the first half of the sixties was so great, that sometimes the greatest competition came from another Mini team. The Cooper Car Company - run by the designer of the Mini Cooper, John Cooper - found itself competing intensely against Broadspeed, who were racing their own versions of the Mini Cooper. Well, <break strength="strong"/> at least it wasn't lonely at the top for Mini.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.22=Did you know that the relaunched Mini was almost a Minki? In 1992, then-owners Rover Group began considering a replacement for the Mini. The MINKI name emerged by fitting a 'K' series engine into the car. The improvements included a 5-speed gearbox, hydragas suspension, better seats, and a hatchback design to enhance luggage space. It tested quite well, and a second version was also made, although, in the end, a new direction was chosen for the brand.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.23=Do you know of famous celebrities who are fans of MINI? There are a lot of them. It all started with the classic Mini, which was loved by everyone, including Hollywood's biggest stars. For example, tall man's man Clint Eastwood owned a Cooper S Traveller, of which only six were ever made. Eastwood loved the car, describing it as having, quote, "all the Mini Cooper S racing gear, but in a mini station wagon. It's a cool car, because there aren't many like it." Unquote. Of course, for the color Clint went with British Racing Green.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.24=Today we see the classic Mini as a car that cannot be improved upon, but that wasn't always the case. Just a few years after its debut, several attempts were made to replace it, including a project led by its creator, Sir Alec Issigonis. The replacement car, codenamed the 9X, was never produced, and the original Mini remained popular for decades. We can only speculate about what could have been.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.25=You might assume that Sir Alec Issigonis, the designer of the original Mini, whose knighthood was largely due to its success, believed his car was perfect. Not so. Within ten years, he was back at the drawing board. This completely new Mini, known as the 9X, was intended to be even smaller and lighter than the original while providing more interior space. Regrettably, the car was never produced.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.26=Were you aware that for our 40th anniversary in 1999, a lot of one-off Minis were created by some pretty big names. The biggest was probably David Bowie, who did something truly unique by wrapping a classic Mini completely in reflective chrome. The only things that didn't get mirror plating were the rear lights and the tires. It was ingeniously subversive from Bowie to create a colorless Mini - a car known for its vibrant colors - and still have it stand out from all the Minis ever made.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.27=Did you know that in 1999, David Bowie created a unique Mini to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Mini? He wrapped the entire car in reflective chrome plating, turning it into a giant mirror. Bowie stated that, quote, "It becomes very hard to see, as the viewer's own image becomes the immediate interface." unquote. Looking at the car, you would always be looking back at yourself, which could lead to actual self-reflection and help you consider your relationship with Mini.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.28=Have you ever looked at a MINI and thought, "That's a MINI I'd kiss"? Well, legendary fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg once collaborated with MINI to create a car that might have tempted you. Made for the HIV/AIDS charity event called the Life Ball, <break strength="medium"/> Furstenberg's red MINI was adorned with colorful lips and features the designer's initials on the bonnet. The roof and alloys are in pure white, creating a striking contrast. Pucker up.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.29=How many people do you think know that 1969's The Italian Job wasn't just the Mini's big showbiz break; it was also where its star, Michael Caine learned to drive. The actor admitted he didn't know how to drive and naturally lacked a driver's license prior to shooting. Luckily for him, most of the driving scenes were shot on closed sets, which don't require such documentation. Not many people know that.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.2=The MINI has always been known as the quintessential British car, but its creator had a very different background. Alexander Arnold Constantine Issigonis was born in 1906 as the son of a Greek father and a German mother, in the city of Smyrna, located today in Turkey. At the age of 16 he moved to Britain where he became an engineer, just like his father. And the rest, as they say, is history.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.30=Did you know that gold bars weren't the only things stolen in the classic 1969 caper movie The Italian Job. The audience was also robbed of a scene featuring three Minis sliding past police cars on an ice rink while Johann Strauss's famous waltz, The Blue Danube is played by an orchestra. The sequence was cut for time but is now included in later releases of the movie as an extra feature. It's a cool scene.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.31=If there was a competition for the coolest cars in a movie chase scene, the Minis from the Italian Job would probably be near the top. Sadly, we'll never see those exact cars again, as they were all destroyed during filming. However, that hasn't stopped enthusiasts from rebuilding them from the couple of parts that remained.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.32=If you have any <prosody rate="slow"> Mini-fan friends </prosody> you'd love to impress, tell them this hilarious inside joke from the classic Mini movie, 1969's The Italian Job: During the scene where the team prepares the Minis for the heist, a character says, quote, "Rozzer's having trouble with his differential", just as we see Rozzer working under the back of a red Mini. The Mini was famously front-wheel-drive and didn't have a rear differential, making it a clever joke. It's sure to get them laughing!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.33=Do you want to hear some spicy gossip that is about 60-years-old at this point? Of course you do. The classic Mini Cooper was a multiple winner of the legendary Monte Carlo rally? Because of its continued success, there's even rumors of a French conspiracy to disqualify it after its victory at the 1966 event - where its dimming device was, despite 4 years without a problem, now forbidden. Luckily, the following year it was allowed to claim official victory yet again. Justice restored!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.34=Did you know that driving a Mini can change your life? According to John Cooper, when the former Chief Designer for Ferrari, Aurelio Lampredi saw the Mini at a racetrack for the first time in 1960, he asked to test drive it. Apparently, Mr. Lampredi loved it so much that he was gone for hours, and when he got back he exclaimed that the Mini was the car of the future. The then Fiat designer also said that, quote, "If it weren't so ugly, I'd shoot myself", unquote! Well, we agree with half of his assessment.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.35=What is your favorite MINI movie moment? We hope you have one, as the brand has been a cinematic star basically since its first debut. The classic Mini's biggest moment on the silver screen was in 1969's The Italian Job. However, it was almost quite different, as the British Motor Corporation only provided a few Minis for the shoot. in contrast, the Mini's Italian competitor Fiat offered the production as many cars as they wanted. However, the producers stuck with the Minis, even paying for them out of their own pocket to make the movie truly British. And it really blew the bloody doors off of the movie industry.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.36=Have you ever dreamed of playing an iconic character in a movie? Well four MINI cars once played the famous ghosts from the Pac-Man arcade game in a movie? In the action-packed PIXELS, starring Adam Sandler and Peter Dinklage, aliens mistake video games for a declaration of war, and send giant Pac-Man and Donkey Kong figures to attack the world. The U.S. government recruits four old-school arcaders to save the day, with each driving their own "MINI Ghost" - four MINI Cooper S 3-door models in the colors of the Pac-Man Ghosts. Our heroes of course, prevail, because with a MINI, you don't even need "God Mode."
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.37=Have you heard that Mini once produced a flatbed pick-up model? Beginning in 1960, around 58,000 of these working heroes were produced in total. What a stylish way to get a big, or small job done!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.38=Hey you, and your cool MINI, can I ask how many countries you've visited in your car? Not that I'd really do much with that information. But it is interesting that even though the MINI and its production has usually been associated with the UK, the classic Mini was at various points manufactured everywhere, from South Africa, and Australia, to Canada, and even Venezuela. A real globetrotter.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.39=Do you ever smile to yourself when you pass another MINI on the road, knowing that you both belong to a pretty cool club? Well imagine how members of the London and Surrey Mini Owners Club felt when in 2009 they organized the largest MINI parade ever, with 1,450 Minis from all over Europe taking part along a 2-mile course at Crystal Palace Park in London.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.3=Did you know that in 1999, when the Car of the Century Awards were being decided, it was self-evident that there could only be one winner: the Model T Ford. So when the classic Mini came in second place - beating the likes of the Citro\u00EBn <say-as interpret-as="spell-out">DS</say-as>, the Volkswagen Beetle, and the Porsche 911 - it actually felt like a victory.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.40=How comfortably are you sitting in your MINI? Pretty comfy, right? Now imagine that there are 28 more people in there with you. Probably a bit too snug, but that is probably why 29 people in a single MINI hatch is a Guinness World Record. The record was set in a 2014 MINI Cooper in China.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.41=You might expect the MINI to hold some interesting records, and it does. The car holds the Guinness World Record for the largest ensemble of car horns. You heard that right: in 2013 400 MINI cars simultaneously tooted the Deep Purple song <break strength="medium"/> "Smoke on the Water" at an event in Michigan USA. Exquisite. It probably blew listeners away.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.42=You probably know that the classic Mini was incredibly versatile, but would you have guessed that it even had a beautiful fastback variant? A fastback is characterized by a single slope from its roof to the end of its boot, and that's exactly what the Mini Broadspeed GT had. But it didn't just have the looks, it was a powerful car that proved its mettle multiple times on the racetrack. Sadly, only 28 were ever built, with most of them exported to Spain, thanks to a talented distributor. Grac\u00EDas.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.43=Did you realize that replacements for the original Mini were being designed as early as the sixties? One of these was called <prosody rate="slow"> "Project Ant" </prosody> . The aim was to include all the things that made the Mini great, such as its clever use of space, but also to be cheaper and less labor intensive to produce. While it simplified a number of things about the Mini, it simply never became a viable option for the future.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.44=Is this your first car? Back in the day it was many people's first major automobile. One of them was Formula One World Champion James Hunt. Before making it big, he was making it small. After failing to gain funding from his father for his racing ambitions, he had to scrape the money together for an older Mini, by working as a builder's mate, van driver and hospital porter. We all have to start somewhere.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.45=You've probably heard that Mini won the legendary Monte Carlo Rally three times during the 1960s. But did you know that there was almost a fourth victory? Mini finished in first place that year as well, but it was disqualified - along with several other Minis - for an alleged headlight infringement. However, the fact that it took 18 hours for the judges to find any fault with the cars,<break strength="strong"/> and that the eventual winners from Citroen were less than enthusiastic about their hollow victory, gave rise to the idea that it was all a conspiracy to stop Mini from winning. But it couldn't be, could it?
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.46=Have you ever looked at a MINI and thought, "wow, what a stud?" Well, you might have, if you looked at the MINI Convertible that New York fashion designer Kenneth Cole created for the HIV/AIDS charity event, called the "Life Ball". Cole gave the car a brushed metal silver body and covered it inside and out in sparkling studs. A MINI has never sparkled like this before.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.47=Have you ever heard that MINI participated in Life Ball, Europe's biggest charity event in support of HIV/AIDS research, for over a decade? For the 2010 event, we showcased our socio-political commitment by creating three unique models with world-renowned fashion designers. Francisco Costa designed a special MINI Countryman, Diane von Furstenberg added her artistic touch to a MINI Hatch, and Kenneth Cole imparted his unmistakable style on a MINI Convertible. These collector's items were auctioned off to raise money for AIDS research. Style... and substance.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.48=Did you know that the two Canadian fashion designers behind the DSQUARED brand created one of the toughest MINIs ever for the HIV/AIDS charity event, Life Ball? The so-called Red Mudder Countryman heavily featured maple leaves, sported a rugged front guard and rally lights. It also had black wheel flaring, a roof rack and tinted side windows. Beyond its looks, it had a raised chassis and deep-tread all-terrain tires. Inside it had a compass, as well as structured aluminum floormats. A car that was made for the red carpet, but really felt at home off it.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.49=Can flowers be used to raise money for life-saving research? In 2012, we proved it was possible when we collaborated with <lang xml:lang="it-IT">Franca Sozzani</lang>, the former chief editor of Italian VOGUE, to design a special MINI Roadster for the Life Ball AIDS/HIV Charity Gala. The unique creation boasted a stylish floral design on the roof, Deepest Purple matt paintwork, and gold MINI rally stripes. As with many of the one-off MINI cars created for the Life Ball, it was auctioned off to raise money for a good cause.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.4=Have you heard that the relaunched MINI was voted the "Car of the Decade" in 2011 by prestigious German automotive publication <lang xml:lang="de-DE">"Automobilwoche"?</lang> The jury chose MINI not just because its financial success, but because it shaped the automobile business over the last decade, creating a wave of similar cars in its wake. We'd like to thank a lot of people, but, <break strength="medium"/> mostly you.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.50=Did you ever see the one-of-a-kind golden MINI Paceman Roberto Cavalli designed for an HIV/AIDS charity event? The Life Ball MINI <say-as interpret-as="date">2013's</say-as> exterior features an exclusive iridescent paint that shimmers between black and gold, while the interior was swathed in black with gilded elements and animal prints. The Cavalli logo could be found on the roof of the car, as well as the headrests and sun visors. This MINI was auctioned for a record-breaking 150,000 euros, with proceeds going towards projects to combat HIV/AIDS.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.51=Did you know that we supported the annual HIV/AIDS charity event, "Life Ball", for over a decade with unique cars? In 2009, The Blonds designed a Katy Perry-inspired MINI, with the star accompanying them down the red carpet. The convertible featured a pink and black leopard print with tassels on the wing mirrors, black faux fur lining on the seats and some of the instruments, and glittery black deep-pile carpeting on the footwells. A truly roaring design.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.52=Did you know that the classic Mini was accepted into London society thanks to a member of the Royal Family? Lord Snowdon, photographer, designer, and friend of Mini designer Alec Issigonis, was one of the first to buy the new small car. He even took a family tour of London with Princess Margaret and their son David in a Mini. Snowdon's sister-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, was also chauffeured by Issigonis through the park of Windsor Castle. Talk about Royal Approval.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.53=Does your MINI give you satisfaction? It probably gave some to Mick Jagger, who got himself a custom coachbuilt Cooper S in 1967. Not much is known about Jagger's Mini, but it had one very unsurprising quality: it had dark shadowlite glass, and apparently it was painted black.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.54=Do you know how the automotive landscape contributed to the creation of the original Mini? The fifties featured a lot of small and low-powered so-called bubble cars, that were cheap, but full of compromises. So many, in fact, that they spurred BMC - Mini's original creators - to make something better. Company leaders told Mini's lead designer Alec Issigonis, quote: <prosody rate="slow"> These bloody awful bubble cars. We must drive them off the streets by designing a proper small car, </prosody> unquote. And that's just what Issigonis did.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.55=Ever imagined a surfer's Airstream trailer, created by Danish furniture makers "Republic of Fritz Hansen", <break strength="strong"/> paired with a MINI Cooper S Clubman? Wonder no more, we've already brought it to life. The Airstream caravan featured a unique minimalist table and chair set, <break strength="medium"/> sleek wood paneling, <break strength="medium"/> while the MINI Cooper S Clubman was painted predominantly jet black with black "wetsuit" neoprene accent, <break strength="medium"/> and bold lightning green highlights, and included a waterproof interior and a sun lounger. Truly a car-caravan combo for those gnarly days of surfing!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.56=Have you ever looked at a MINI and thought: "If I could just attach a trailer to this, I could really hit the beach?" Well, we're one step ahead of you. In 2009 we joined forces with Danish premium furniture makers, "Republic of Fritz Hansen", and created a unique MINI Clubman combined with an Airstream trailer that was fitted to deliver a MINI surfing lifestyle.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.57=Have you ever heard of the stylish Mini Beach Cars? They were indeed rare gems off the company's production line. With fewer than 20 ever built, they were all left-hand drive except for one. This extra special one was a right-hand drive car that was loaned to none other than Queen Elizabeth II, who even drove it around Windsor Castle.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.58=Have you heard of the classic Mini variant that was so hot to handle that we removed its doors?  The Mini Beach cars were created in the 1960s to take advantage of the craze for small cars that was going on at the time. These small automobiles featured: <break strength="weak"/> no B-pillars, <break strength="medium"/> windows, <break strength="medium"/> or doors, <break strength="medium"/> and were meant for a clientele who might need a small convenient beach car to go with their yacht. Some of the most famous owners of such cars included Henry Ford, John Wayne, and Grace Kelly.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.59=Have you heard of the stylish Mini Beach Cars of the 1960s? With no windows, doors, or B-pillars, they were perfect for generating interest in the brand in the United States. BMC's San Francisco outlet even organized a race with these cars, featuring drivers like Stirling Moss and Pedro Rodriguez. However, the race proved quite chaotic with some cars rolling over.  Probably not the PR the spin doctors were looking for.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.5=Would you believe that we created the "Creative Use of Space" awards? Sounds about right, doesn't it. But would you be able to guess what it was for? Interior design? Professional diorama builders? No, it was for the most creative snowboarding performance in the Burton Global Open Series. Done in partnership with the snowboard-producer, we let the public vote on the  best male and female rider, who shared the 50,000 dollar prize. Pretty Shreddin', we're sure you'd agree.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.60=Have you seen the most colorful Mini ever? <break strength="medium"/> It has 26 colors just on its exterior. The one-off classic Mini was created by the legendary designer Paul Smith for the 40th anniversary celebrations of Mini. Smith created a Mini that had 86 stripes on its outside while still maintaining a harmonious look. The inspiration unsurprisingly came from Smith's own 1997 spring and summer collection. Chic.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.61=These days the Cooper name is ubiquitous, but can you believe that it was actually a Special Edition car helped relaunch the sporty <break strength="weak"/> Cooper type of Mini cars? While it may be hard to believe today, the Cooper was only produced until 1971, and was then absent from the Mini lineup for more than two decades. But in 1990, we released the Mini Rover Special Products, or RSP. It was the first Cooper in 21 years, and it sold out before even hitting showrooms, sending a clear message that there was demand for a new Mini Cooper.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.62=Did you know that we broke two records at the 2004 Olympic Games? First, we crammed 21 flexible people into a MINI. But that was nothing compared to the MINI Cooper S XXL, which saw our 3.6-metre MINI Cooper S <break strength="medium"/> stretched to a whopping 6.3 meters. To accommodate the extra body length, the MINI XXL was supported by a third rear axle, with two additional wheels, giving the MINI Limousine a total of 6 wheels. And if that wasn't enough, it also had a hot tub in the back.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.63=The MINI is known as a small car, but were you aware that in 2004, we created a 6.3-meter-long MINI that had a hot tub in the back? But the MINI Cooper S XXL also had surprises on its inside. It had a retractable flat-screen TV that also served as a movable partition to the driver's cabin. Once you kicked back and relaxed, you had the option of a full entertainment system and a rear phone to communicate with the driver. Of course, no lively limo is complete without a sunroof, so the XXL had one as well.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.64=We all think that the MINI is a rather small car, but that is not always true. In 2004, we created a MINI limousine that had a hot tub in the back. It was just a tad longer than the 3.6-meter-long, 2001 MINI. Indeed, it was actually 6.3 meters in length, setting a record. And where did such a MINI debut? At the place where records are meant to be broken: the Olympics.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.65=Have you ever heard that MINI participated in Life Ball, Europe's biggest charity event combating HIV/AIDS, for over a decade? In 2010, the Calvin Klein Collection's award-winning Women's Creative Director, Francisco Costa, designed a Countryman model that was restrained but still could dominate any showroom it showed up in. Why? Because it was blacker than black, featuring a matte black finish all over, with Calvin Klein Collection stamped on the outside and inside. The Black Edition earned 40,000 Euros for AIDS research. Chapeau.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.66=Did you know that in 1988, Mary Quant designed her own Special Edition Mini? The legendary designer had already made history with the brand: when she popularized short skirts in the 1960s, she named it after her favorite car, calling it the mini skirt. Her Special Edition car: The Mini Designer Mary Quant was a limited edition of a thousand cars and featured some of her signature design elements, as well as a bonnet badge bearing her name. Chic.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.67=You have probably heard that the original Mini was not exactly the fastest car. But did you know that the original prototype was much faster? Indeed, the engine size was reduced for the production version, from 948cc to 848cc. The reason? The prototypes easily reached about 150 km/h, which was deemed way too fast for the target market. Of course, this would change in due time.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.68=You probably think the classic Mini's look is timeless, but did you know that even close to production it was not considered up to scratch? The pre-production Mini was deemed to be too plain and boring. The Managing Director of BMC - the company behind the Mini - told lead designer Alec Issigonis: quote,  <prosody rate="slow"> "We'll never sell that. Spend another few quid on it Alec, and jazz it up a bit." </prosody> Unquote. And they did, <break strength="medium"/> by adding quite a few chrome enhancements. And people really took a shine to it.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.69=Have you ever thought to yourself, "How cool it would be if there was an ice cream van version of the MINI?" Well, your sweet dreams are more than dreams, they're a reality. The Mini Ice Cream Van was created back in the day from the classic Mini in the UK, but sold abroad as well. Even though these cars have an average lifespan of 15 years, there are still some in service today. Some couples still insist on having the Mini ice cream van cater for their big day. So even though there aren't many left, don't be too surprised if you see one at an event in the future!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.6=Obviously we're not bad at making cars. Some - like the readers of specialist motoring magazine "Autocar" - might even say we're pretty good. In a 1995 vote, they named the Mini the "Car of the Century", and in 2012 they named it "The greatest British car ever made". They praised Mini for its groundbreaking design and because it was deemed to have had a greater impact on the British car industry than any other automobile. No wonder it remains a motoring icon to this day.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.70=Do you know what the coolest Mini ever is? The Mini Ice Cream van. It was created from the classic Mini Pickup by removing just the roof and back, and is affectionately called the Batmobile Mini by many, although it delivers icy goodness instead of justice. The reason for the name is that the Mini Ice Cream Van took its design inspiration from an unusual place: the 1960s Batman television show starring Adam West.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.71=Have you ever heard that despite the numerous different versions created from the original 1959 Mini, the first production Convertible didn't arrive until 1993? The reason for Rover's decision to make the car was due to the success of a limited series of 75 convertibles commissioned by their German dealer, Lamm. The popularity of these convertibles convinced Rover to create their own version of the Mini Convertible and go topless.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.72=Were you aware that although there are many Special Edition MINIs available today, we had to wait a long time after the original Mini's 1959 debut for the first one? The Mini Limited Edition 1000, also known as "Stripey," was not only special because it was the first, but also because most of its unique features - such as being the first round-nosed Mini with eyeball air vents, twin chrome door mirrors, and reclining front seats - were quickly adopted for standard car production
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.73=Were you aware that before the 2001 relaunch of the MINI, the idea of a completely new MINI was long in the pipeline? Even before the brand's 1994 acquisition by the BMW Group, then owners Rover had multiple designs drawn up, with the most popular being a three-seater car, with the driver sitting in a central position. Could you imagine if the new MINI had a quasi-F1 style design?
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.74=Have you ever heard that 1969's original Mini Clubman was based on two existing models? The Austin Seven Countryman and the Morris Mini Traveller both featured the barn-style rear doors that would define the later Clubman's aesthetic.  That's inspiration we can get behind!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.75=Have you ever looked at a classic Mini and thought <break strength="strong"/> Gee, it really has a simple design. You'd be right on the money. The original Mini's design was so simple in fact, that turning it into a number of different variants was a no-brainer: soon after its debut, there was a pick-up truck version, as well as a van. There were also stylish beach cars made from it, but also a jeep-like buggy called the Mini Moke. Just to name a few.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.76=When you think about 1969 - as you probably often do\u00A0? do you ever realize that it was about more than just free love, the moon landing, and great music? It also gave the world the first ever Mini Clubman! Roy Haynes? classic saloon design added a longer, angular nose to the original Mini, adding an extra iconic charm. And the saloon car was followed by the Clubman Estate in 1970. And history was made!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.77=What kind of MINI do you drive? We're only asking because even if you've never owned a MINI Clubman, you are probably familiar with its famous swinging twin rear doors. But not many know that the reason for the two doors is because the production lines at Mini factories in the 1960's were too snug. To put it simply, there wasn't enough space to make a "single-door" design without the door hitting the next car behind it. Sometimes an unexpected challenge can lead to iconic solutions.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.78=Did you hear the one about the wooden car? Back in 1960, the Austin Mini Countryman, and the Morris Mini Traveller both came with wooden struts on the B pillar, for that classic home-grown look.  And though they were purely decorative, these wooden effects gave the cars an undeniable touch of charm. <prosody rate="slow"> Wood you believe it? </prosody>
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.79=What do you think, would you have bought an original Mini if you were growing up in the sixties? Or would you tastes have been more premium? Well then you're in luck, because while the original Mini might have been super humble, there were "luxury versions" produced of the car under other badges. The Wolseley Hornet and Riley Elf had a different front and an added boot, giving them a more spacious saloon shape.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.7=Here's something you might not know: Just because the original Mini ceased production at the turn of the century, that didn't mean that enthusiastic fans stopped producing new versions of the car. For example, the Banham Roadster from 2003 gave the classic a full-on speedster-like makeover. The car sports a chopped-down windscreen, twin roll-hoops behind its two seats, as well as a removable rear cover panel. Perhaps the Mini's style is eternal.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.81=You probably know that we at MINI are quite charming - almost as charming as MINI owners. That's why when we went to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup, we dressed a MINI Countryman in a gigantic Makarapa hat. Makarapa is a unique and quirky South African football style that involves wearing a handcrafted and colorfully painted workman's helmet. It really helped us stand out in a crowd of vuvuzelas.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.82=Have you ever heard of the Mini Wildgoose? It was a motorhome version of the Mini that added a bed, a sink, and a wardrobe. Sound promising? Well there's more. As extras you could get a top luggage rack, extended wing mirrors, and a hammock-type bunk. The most stunning feature of the Wildgoose was the "Brent" version's "vertically extending body". This allows drivers to literally raise the roof, using a button situated on the dashboard. The Wildgoose might not have provided a luxurious experience, but it was one like none other.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.83=Have you ever heard of the most radical Mini ever? Called the Wildgoose, this car was an entire motorhome created from a classic Mini. With a motorized roof that could provide headroom of 218 cm, this car had it all. The high-end version of the Wildgoose had enough sleeping space for four people. It also provided a 4-seater dinette, a sink, a hot plate, two 2-gallon water carriers, a table, a wardrobe, cupboards, and, of course, curtains for some privacy, and to keep out the morning sun.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.84=You probably know that many different cars have been created based on the original Mini, but probably none come close to the cult classic Mini Wildgoose. This small motorhome gave a new meaning to the phrase, "creative use of space". Three versions of the camper van were created, with two featuring pop-up tents in the rear, while the third and most striking - the "Brent" - had a telescopic roof that doubled the headroom. A truly wild Mini.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.85=What was the biggest birthday party you have ever been to? When MINI turned 50, a three-day event was held at Silverstone, with over 25,000 fans from more than 40 countries and over 10,000 MINI models, most of them lovingly customized. The whole event was a mix of racing action, music festival, and lifestyle spectacle, with a whole host of celebrities. Wish you could have been there... And if you were - Hi! <break strength="medium"/> Nice seeing you again.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.86=What do you think the classic Mini is most famous for? Its looks? Its revolutionary design? Its effect on pop-culture? Its longevity? Yes, all of those, but the Mini is also famous for its racing history. Its first success came just two years after its debut, when John Whitmore won the 1961 British Saloon Car Championship in his Mini. And it only got more exciting from there.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.87=Did you know that we made history by becoming the first car manufacturer to take on the  <lang xml:lang="de-DE">N\u00FCrburgring-Nordschleife</lang> circuit with an electric car? The MINI E Race, a modified race-spec version of the standard MINI E, completed a lap in under 10 minutes, hitting a top speed of 187 km/h. Thanks to the lack of noise from the drivetrain, the racing experience was clean and quiet, even at that speed. Swift... and soundless.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.88=You might think that the original Mini was so versatile that it could basically be turned into anything, but the new MINI is no slouch either. Case in point: the MINI John Cooper Works Buggy was an off-road competition car that really conquered new frontiers, winning six Dakar Rallies between 2012 and 2021.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.89=You're driving a MINI, so you're pretty cool in our books. But what did you achieve before your tenth birthday? We're just asking as by the time the Mini <break strength="medium"/> in its Cooper and Cooper S variants were ten, they had already won multiple Monte Carlo Rallies, British Saloon Car Championships, as well as European Touring Car Championships. A small wonder(kid).
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.8=You probably think that the original Mini's design is timeless, but that didn't stop attempts to create a new Mini even as early as the sixties. One of these was the Pininfarina-inspired BMC Mini Sports. As the name suggests, it would have had a very different style to the Mini, almost like a small fastback sportscar. It was also considerably longer, using the Mini Van as its base. The project never got far enough for a public presentation, but imagine what could have been.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.90=Would you believe that one of history's most famous Minis, Mr. Bean's Mini, became so iconic in part thanks to Rowan Atkinson's fanaticism? Atkinson is a well-known car enthusiast. As well as having owned many supercars, he's driven in races and also has a truck driving license. With this in mind, it is unsurprising that he always wanted to make Mr. Bean's car an important part of the show. So it became more than a prop; it became a character unto itself.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.91=Did you know that the iconic television character, Mr. Bean's very first Mini, which made its debut in the pilot episode, was orange? The car didn't survive the episode, but it established one of the show's most iconic running gags: its rivalry with the three-wheeled Reliant Robin. Rowan Atkinson chose the Reliant Robin due to his lack of respect for the car. And while his Mini was orange, it already featured some iconic elements, such as the padlock that Mr. Bean used to lock it.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.92=Do you know the scene from the Mr. Bean television series <break strength="medium"/> where he buys an armchair that doesn't fit into his Mini? He ties it to the top of the car, and drives home while sitting in it and controlling the car with brooms and strings. While it's true that Rowan Atkinson did sit on the chair, which he was of course safely tied to, the car was actually driven by a stunt driver who was lying on the floor, navigating thanks to a small screen in front of him. It's still funny, but less dangerous.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.93=Do you know who the most famous Mini owner of all time is? Here's a hint: it's a fictional character. Think you got it? You probably do. We're talking about Mr. Bean, who famously had a green Mini. Except he didn't have just one single Mini, no, during his television and film career he had at least 6. And his first Mini wasn't green, it was orange.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.94=What's your favorite Mr. Bean sketch featuring the Mini? The one where he gets dressed while driving to the dentist? Where he spends minutes going from hidden key to hidden key, only for his car to not start? When it was crushed by a tank? Or when he drives it with an armchair fastened to its roof? All are equally funny and iconic, so much so that Rowan Atkinson has recreated the latter scene for charity on occasions. Mini: giving the people what they want since 1959.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.95=You know the iconic television character Mr. Bean? And you also know his car, don't you. But when you think of Mr. Bean's Mini, do you think of a single greenish-yellow Mini with a black bonnet? So do most. But there was never "one" single Mini. Mr. Bean had at least six Minis throughout his career, partly because his adventures often led to his cars being destroyed. Parts were also often taken out of previously used models and put into other cars during production. Interestingly, what is certain is that the car is not a classic Mini Cooper. Still funny though.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.96=You probably know that the famous television character, Mr. Bean, drove a Mini, but did you know why? It was mostly thanks to Rowan Atkinson, the actor who played the character. Mr. Bean was originally created for the stage with just a few props, so having a car was a natural addition to the TV show. Atkinson chose the Mini because of its inherently funny nature and because he had learned to drive in his mother's Morris Minor as a young man. He also picked the car's distinctive lime green color because he wanted it to be a color he would never choose for himself. And the rest is history!
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.97=Apart from the MINI's storied movie career, it has also played a big role in the music industry. A MINI was featured in Madonna's 2003 song and music video "American Life". In 2010, Bruno Mars drove a MINI in Travie McCoy's global smash hit "Billionaire". A year later, Britney Spears made a pink MINI Convertible a big part of her Femme Fatale tour.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.98=All big stories start out small. That was definitely the case for Austrian Formula One legend Niki Lauda. Before he hit it big in the seventies, Lauda started his racing career at the <lang xml:lang="de-DE">M\u00FChlbacken </lang>Hillclimb in 1968, driving a Mini Cooper. Although he came in second, it was only onwards and upwards for his racing career. And not just because of the hill climb.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.99=How much would you do for a Mini? That's a question Formula One legend Niki Lauda probably asked himself when he wanted his parents to support his burgeoning racing career. And the Austrian had something pretty devious up his sleeve. He forged a college certificate, which was a gambit that paid off immediately as his proud parents gave him a brand new 1275cc Cooper. Of course, we cannot condone this behavior in any shape or form.
customPersonality.funFact.success.heritage.9=You may have heard that the classic Mini had great successes in rally and saloon car racing, but did you know that there was almost an open-wheel, single seater Mini designed for Formula racing as well? Called the Formula Mini Plus, the idea even made it to the a prototype stage. It had an output of about 90 brake horsepower, which came from a series engine in its Mini subframe at the front, and a simple chassis with four fiberglass body sections. Sadly the small and inexpensive little Formula Mini Plus never made it to the grid of an official race, and was retired before it ever had a chance to shine.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.0=Did you know that we are the first car brand that had its own club? Well, when we say own, we're cheating, but just a bit. You see in 2012 we took our Amsterdam Brand Store, which usually sold our Lifestyle Collection, and turned it into an exclusive club in the heart of the city, for the five-day Amsterdam Dance Event. It was just fitting, as the theme of the Lifestyle Collection that year was "The Sound of MINI."
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.10=Can you believe that MINI once brought Hollywood to Geneva? In an unconventional marketing campaign, the city of Geneva was renamed "MINIWOOD" to celebrate the launch of the new MINI Countryman in 2010. A huge projected image of the "MINIWOOD" sign was visible for miles around, and busy areas of the city were adorned with "MINIWOOD stars" to guide visitors to the motor show. To complete the Hollywood-style experience, a MINI Countryman was even parked and displayed on a red carpet. Swanky.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.11=Have you ever looked at the clothes of dancers in a music video, and thought to yourself: <break strength="strong"/> "ooohh, I'd like that"? We have. When we released our 2015 MINI Collection, we let fans shop for fashion and accessories using iTunes. The MINI Collection Screendancer plug-in recognized a song's rhythm, and real dancers would move to the beat, allowing users to watch these impromptu music videos and shop for the dancers' outfits at the same time. It was a MINI Boogie Wonderland.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.1=When you're MINI, sometimes your promotional campaigns are launched by actual royalty. That's what happened in 2013, when the MINI John Cooper Works went on the GREAT Britain MINI Tour to showcase British culture in Germany. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie of York even kicked off the tour by driving the MINI - in Union Jack design - from the Brandenburg Gate to the British Embassy. Now that is what we call royal approval.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.2=The original Mini is so deceptively simple, you'd think you could put it together yourself. Well, thanks to Lego, you can. Kind of. Because in <say-as interpret-as="date">2014</say-as> Lego released a 1,077-part set of the classic Mini Cooper. The model features authentic details such as a British Racing Green body, <break strength="strong"/>white roof, <break strength="strong"/> bonnet stripes, <break strength="strong"/> and even a fully packed picnic basket in the luggage compartment. It also maintains its authentic British identity, with the steering wheel on the right-hand side and a yellow number plate at the rear.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.3=We at MINI always like looking into the future. That's why we created MINI Augmented Vision <say-as interpret-as="spell-out">AR</say-as> glasses in 2015. The design concepts were meant to project relevant information into the driver's field of vision, increasing safety and comfort while driving. They featured destination entry, contact-analogue navigation, messaging, and even an X-Ray view of vehicle parts. Plus, with Augmented Parking, drivers could easily ascertain the distance from the curb. Will the concept ever become reality? We'll see.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.4=You've heard of a minibar, but how about a MINI <break strength="medium"/> Bar? For the launch of the new MINI in <say-as interpret-as="date">2014</say-as>we opened just that: the world's first MINI Bar in Budapest. Located in the heart of the city - as is appropriate for MINI - the bar featured charming details, DJ-sets, while serving cheeky food and cocktails inspired by MINI. So you could say, that when it comes to branded entertainment, <break strength="strong"/> we like to set the bar pretty high.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.5=What happens when you mix snowboarding with art? MINI and Canadian artist Geoff McFetridge have the answer. For the Burton European Open in Switzerland 2015, we created a "Signpost Forest" art installation that reinvented familiar piste signage with creative and pretty funny - if we do say so ourselves - graphics, that deconstructed the white world of snowboarders. Because we at MINI love to bring some of that cheeky creativity to the places where it is least expected.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.6=Why do you like MINI? Is it because of how it drives? <break strength="x-weak"/> how it looks? <break strength="x-weak"/> The tech or the features? Well, hopefully all of those, but you also probably like MINI for its style and authenticity. And you wouldn't be the only one. For a Superbowl ad we didn't do the usual brand-thing and pay people to talk about us. No, we had actual MINI owners like Serena Williams and Harvey Keitel talk about the brand, which helped show the world that we are really the brand for people who don't just talk the talk, but who walk - or rather, drive - the walk.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.7=Have you ever seen a MINI that is not built, but knitted? It does exist, and while it's not a MINI you can drive, its one you can cuddle. At 26 centimeters in length the MINI 3-door is a MINI Original Product that doesn't give you the same go-kart feeling, but can still warm your heart. A soft filling along with lovingly embroidered details such as headlamps, rear light units and license plates ensure a truly unique cuddling pleasure.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.8=Whether it's your child's birthday, or Christmas getting close, why create needless stress for yourself when you can choose from a large selection of great MINI Lifestyle gifts? Take the MINI Baby Racer, which is, as the name suggests a mini MINI for your child. It's equipped with many of the design features of a full-sized MINI Hatch, and fitted with low-noise rubber tires and a soft, removable and washable seat cushion. Check out the current Collection online or visit your MINI dealer. Just make sure your little one takes as much care of their car as you do of yours.
customPersonality.funFact.success.lifestyle.9=Have you ever driven a classic Mini? Maybe you will, you see the classic Mini cars have received a new lease on life. The MINI Recharged project - launched in 2022 - converts classic Minis into electric cars. This way the project extends the life of these much-loved vehicles, and allows fans to experience that original go-kart feeling sustainably. Each electrified classic Mini receives a modern electric motor that generates up to 90 kW and can accelerate from zero to 100 km/h in approximately nine seconds. Quite the buzz.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.0=Have you heard how a <prosody rate="slow"> young David Bowie worked for BMC - </prosody> the original makers of the Mini? There are pictures circulating that claim to show the legendary artist creating Minis in his youth, but this is simply a myth. Bowie would have been about 12 years old during the production of the first Mini, so he definitely didn't work on any Mini production lines. However, he did design a one-of-a-kind Mini wrapped in reflective chrome for the company's 40th birthday. We may be bragging a bit, but who wouldn't? </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.10=It probably doesn't come as a surprise, but even such a unique brand as MINI can be enriched by the talents of others. We have many frequent collaborators who we like to think of as friends. Paul Smith, the legendary designer is one of them. It's he who helped us create <prosody rate="slow"> the MINI Strip, </prosody> a radical version of the fully electric MINI that took the idea <break strength="medium"/> "less is more" <break strength="medium"/> to its limit. The car was stripped to its essentials - no paint, no central console, but lots of recycled materials - creating a truly radically sustainable version of the car.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.11=Not everyone can handle  <prosody rate="slow"> the MINI go-kart feeling. </prosody>  Even movie stars suffer sometimes, with Mark Wahlberg, star of 2003's The Italian Job, frequently getting sick from the car's extreme movements.\u00A0So don't worry if you get a little motion sick: <prosody rate="slow"> you're in good company.</prosody>  </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.12=It's good to have inspiring friends! That's why we cherish our relationship with legendary designer Paul Smith, who we've been collaborating with for more than two decades. <s> </s>  It all started in the nineties, when Sir Paul used Mini as a motif in one of his women's fashion collections. He then created his own Special Edition Mini, painted in Paul Smith Blue, as well as a multi colored one-off Mini celebrating our 40th anniversary. <s> </s> What a way to kick off a friendship!</speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.13=How fast did you fall in love with MINI? <break strength="strong"/> For many, it's love at first sight. Take John Cooper - who the sporty Coopers are named after. At the beginning of the sixties he was already a legendary engineer, having just won two Formula-1 championships, and was working on his latest project. However, as soon as he drove the Mini, he dropped that endeavor and devoted himself to creating a sportier version of the car. <prosody rate="slow"> And just like that, Mini's legendary sports career began. </prosody>  </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.14=Have you heard of Smokey? That's English Mini racer John Rhodes, so nicknamed for the heavy smoke his tires emitted while cornering. And it sure did the trick, often putting him on the winner's podium and ensuring that anyone left behind couldn't see a thing. That's racing spirit! </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.15=We would never condone gambling, but we bet you didn't know that a woman was responsible for putting the fastest MINI ever built on the road. Petra Beck, a project manager for BMW and MINI, was tasked with completing the 2020 MINI John Cooper Works GP, which boasted 306 horsepower. Beck's career in electrical engineering began simply because, in her own words, "I was just excited about math and physics." It goes to show that sometimes, even the simplest dreams can take you far.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.16=Some friendships last a lifetime. Take ours with the legendary Rauno Aaltonen. The Finnish driver - winner of the Monte Carlo Rally in 1967 - was known for his meticulous preparation, and ability to explain clearly and simply <break strength="medium"/> how he drove so frighteningly fast, but still safely. The Rally Professor, as he was known, would unsurprisingly become the first chief instructor at BMW Driver Training, which today is more familiar as the BMW and MINI Driving Experience.  </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.17=What did you receive for Christmas last year? In 2020, Rauno Aaltonen, the winner of the Monte Carlo Rally in 1967, found himself in lockdown during the holidays. So we became his Secret Santa. We sent him a classic Mini, similar to the one in which he won his most famous race, in a motorized sleigh. Instead of reindeer, the container containing his gift was pulled by a MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 to a Finnish forest. The then-82-year-old legend loved his present. And what's your favorite gift?  </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.18=MINI knows what it's like to be an underdog, which is why we celebrate diversity whenever we can. In 2021 we partnered up with three renowned US designers <break strength="medium"/> with first generation immigrant backgrounds - from the Philippines, Ireland and China. We asked them to design unique MINI rooftops that reflected their heritage and culture. The results were vibrant, exciting <break strength="medium"/> and told the kind of stories we love to champion.</speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.19=MINI cars are pretty well put-together, but what could we learn if we took them apart? That was the question the Dutch design duo  <lang xml:lang="nl-NL"> Scholten and Baijings </lang> answered with their, "COLOUR ONE" installation in 2012. They took a MINI One completely apart to investigate its composition and design, and allowed people to look at each element in a new way. It was also a great way <prosody rate="slow"> for us to examine our process and improve on it. Now that's what we call insight. </prosody> </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.1=Here's something that might surprise you: The relaunched MINI faced some reservations before its premiere. A few people were afraid that the new MINI introduced at the turn of the Millenium wouldn't have the speed and go-kart feeling of the original. But that fear was probably put to rest quite quickly, especially with movies such as 2003's the Italian Job, which the car starred in. Indeed the film's other star, Mark Wahlberg, was probably one of the first people to know exactly how wild the MINI could get. As he confessed that while driving the, quote, "intensely-powered Go-Kart", unquote, was incredibly fun, he did throw up in it.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.20=Can you believe that one of the first people to drive the newly introduced MINI Countryman in 2010, was four-time Formula One World Champion <lang xml:lang="de-DE"> Sebastian Vettel? </lang> He drove it during his stay in Budapest at the Hungarian Grand Prix, two months before its market launch. <lang xml:lang="de-DE"> Vettel, </lang> who was only 4th in the Driver's Championship at the time, would - for the very first time - go on to win it that year. Are we saying driving the black MINI Cooper S Countryman contributed to his victory in some way? No. <break strength="strong"/> but we're not denying it either.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.21=If you bought a new MINI, would you let a skateboarder jump it? Of course not, that's madness. But what if the skateboarder was Tony Hawk and it was part of a collaboration that included Mini-themed limited-edition skateboards - to be auctioned off for charity. That doesn't seem that mad, does it? Which is why we did just that with the legendary skater in 2014.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.22=What can Sir Alec Issigonis, the original Mini's designer teach us? To never give up. Despite failing his mathematics exams three times and not being admitted to university even after he had obtained his diploma, he pursued his dream of becoming an automobile engineer. Then one of his early design projects was discontinued due to cost issues. A big reason he still had the chance to prove himself was the Suez Oil crisis, which necessitated the development of a frugal small car. He seized the opportunity with two hands, and the rest, as they say, is history.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.2=Have you ever heard that the man who would help make Mini a racing legend, John Cooper, already noticed the Mini's tremendous potential in 1959 after driving a pre-production model. Cooper immediately began tuning the car, and his instincts would be quickly proven right. In September 1960, Cooper asked Roy Salvadori to drive a prototype Mini Cooper to Monza, to the Italian Grand Prix. This drive turned into a race, with Reg Parnell pursuing the Mini Cooper in an Aston Martin DB4. To everyone's surprise - except John Cooper's - the Mini arrived about an hour before its opponent.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.3=You probably know that John Cooper is one of the reasons people love Mini, since he created the Mini Cooper in the 1960s. But did you know he was already a legend-in-the-making before then? As the co-founder of the Cooper Car Company with his father, he created the modern racing car, by popularizing the mid-rear engined design. His teams then went on to win back-to-back Formula-1 World Championships in 1959 and 1960.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.4=We're always looking to spread the positive message of BIG LOVE. And such a message deserves a big canvas. <break strength="strong"/> A Really big canvas. <break strength="strong"/> So everyone can see it. Something as big as the side of an entire factory building. Coincidentally that is exactly what London-born artist Lakwena Maciver used as a canvas in 2021, to help spread our message. In cooperation with us she turned the side of a factory tower in Munich Germany into a gigantic vibrant mural with the words <break strength="medium"/> "Different but Good Together." We're sure you agree.
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.5=Did you hear that the man behind Ferrari was also a huge Mini fan? According to John Cooper himself, Enzo Ferrari owned 3 different Mini Coopers, for racing around in the Italian hills. One of them, a Mini Cooper 1300 S, was personally delivered by the original Mini's designer, Alec Issigonis himself! </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.6=Did you know that the stars of 2003's, "The Italian Job", all did their own MINI stunt driving? <s> </s> After weeks of driving school, the actors got to show off their own intense go-kart skills - and Charlize Theron was a particularly impressive racer.  <s> </s> That's what we call girl power in action. </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.7=We love bringing more color to the world. That is why we decided to create the world's first ever <prosody rate="slow"> electric Mini Art Piece.</prosody> We took a classic Mini that had been newly fitted with an electric engine <prosody rate="slow"> - as part of the MINI Recharged Project - </prosody> and gave it to London-based artist Lakwena Maciver. She turned the car into an art piece that celebrates <prosody rate="slow"> BIG LOVE  <break strength="medium"/> for people, <break time="10ms"/> progress, <break time="10ms"/> and the planet </prosody>, by adorning the car in bold and warm colors. Making it a thoroughly deserving ambassador for this unique upcycling endeavor. </speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.8=Did you know that we were prominent supporters of the famous HIV/AIDS charity event, The Vienna Life Ball, for more than a decade? Many a special MINI was presented at the event, mostly with the purpose of being auctioned off for charity. MINI cars designed by such names as Agent Provocateur, <break strength="medium"/> Donatella Versace, <break strength="medium"/> <prosody rate="slow"> Diesel, </prosody> <break strength="medium"/> Missoni <break strength="medium"/> and <lang xml:lang="it-IT"> Gianfranco Ferr\u00E9.  </lang> The Life Ball MINI models generated more than half a million euros. Good cars, for a good cause.</speak>
customPersonality.funFact.success.people.9=Have you heard that MINI UK and the London Philharmonic Orchestra once gave the British national anthem an unusual twist? To celebrate the upcoming Olympics, nine professional musicians from the orchestra, and nine, MINI London two thousand twelve Special Edition models teamed-up <break time='100ms'/> to play "God Save the Queen" using just car horns. The musicians produced a harmonious sound, as harmonious as nine car horns can get... all in all, it was a blowout.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.0=When you're thinking about what you're next MINI is going to be like, you're probably thinking about how you'll use it more sustainably. But sustainability is not just about how the car drives, but what it's made of. And aluminum <break strength="medium"/> An essential metal in the production process, generates a significant carbon footprint. That's why we at the BMW Group try to minimize it by using 40%, and rising, recycled materials in our cast aluminum parts. So keep that in mind.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.10=Do you value sustainability? Of course you do, as do we. And that sometimes requires taking care of business, literally. That is why we collect the rainwater that falls on the 8,000 square meter roof of our plant in Swindon England. This is then used to flush the factory's toilets, among other things of course.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.11=Are you aware of our sustainability work? We know it's a long way to go, but we also know that every small step is important. And we're not only trying to make our cars more sustainable, but ourselves as well. That is why we've covered the roof of our plant in Oxford England with 11,500 solar panels. The 20,000 square meter solar park has an output of three megawatts, helping decrease the carbon footprint of MINI Plant Oxford by 1,500 tons of CO2 per year.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.12=You probably know that we are committed to making our business more sustainable, but have you considered that sustainability does not only mean caring for the Earth, but also for communities as well? That is why the BMW Group sources cobalt and lithium for its batteries only from mines in Australia and Morocco, that meet the highest social and sustainability standards.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.13=You probably know the saying <break strength="medium"/> "take care of your own backyard." But it's not only applicable to people's personal responsibilities, but those of brand's as well. Especially when it comes to important things like sustainability. And we at MINI like to take care of our home. The 11,500 solar panels on the roof of the MINI plant in Oxford England generate an impressive three megawatts of green electricity, which is enough to supply the needs of 850 households.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.14=Can you believe that the 8,000 square meter flat roof of our Swindon plant is used to collect rainwater to <break strength="weak"/> <prosody rate="slow"> among other things, </prosody> water the factory's green spaces? <break strength="strong"/> It just goes to show that sustainability doesn't need to be high-tech, sometimes it's about being aware of, and using, the simplest things.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.15=Have you heard that we are taking steps to reduce ocean pollution, by incorporating recycled fishing nets and ropes in our vehicles? By using these recycled materials, we are able to reduce the carbon footprint of our components by about 25%, while also conserving resources and helping to reduce ocean pollution. Our goal is to increase the proportion of secondary materials in our new vehicle plastics to 40% by 2030, and we see the ocean as a potential source of these materials.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.16=How about this for a bright idea? Our employees have reduced electricity consumption at our plant in Oxford England, by 41%, by replacing 18,000 incandescent bulbs with LED ones. Simple, yet effective.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.1=Can you do anything before you had your morning coffee? <prosody rate="slow"> Exactly. </prosody> Your car is the same: it requires energy to operate. So, if you're looking to save energy and drive greener, it may be better to lower your windows instead of turning on the air conditioning. If you do use it, set it to a comfortable temperature - there's no need to turn your car into a freezer!
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.2=Here's something you might not have known: there's more to driving greener than what your car runs on! Because it's also about how much its carrying. Always try to keep excess baggage out of your vehicle and only take with you what you need. This lowers the carload, and by extension, its consumption, saving you money as well.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.3=Do you want to drive more sustainably? It's all about being a smooth operator. If you see a red light, don't arrive at full speed, and brake suddenly, but coast, and decrease your car's speed naturally. The light may turn green before you arrive, so you won't even have to accelerate from a standstill, which is much better for the environment.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.4=A little sunshine can go a long way. Did you know that the solar park on the roof of the MINI plant in Oxford England, reduces the production facility's carbon footprint by 1,500 tons of CO2 per year. We hope that thought brightens your day.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.5=In the last couple of years we've really shifted gears when it comes to sustainability, focusing not just how on a MINI drives, but how it's made. That is why we are committed to a circular economy, which means reusing and recycling as many materials as possible. And it is sorely needed. The annual production of about 2.5 million BMW Group vehicles generates around 780,000 tons of waste. And there are valuable resources in those leftover materials. That's why 99% of waste in 2021 was recycled or recovered. With this, we are laying the foundations for sustainability that begins right at the production of the vehicles.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.6=A devotion to sustainability doesn't have to fill you with anxiety, it can also spur you to do progressive and positive things, and really bring some sunshine into your life. It did for us: That's why the roof of our plant in Oxford England is fitted with 11,500 solar panels - the size of five soccer pitches - which covers 100% of the production facility's energy needs.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.7=Have you ever heard the truly shocking fact that the first ever electric MINIs were built for the 2003 movie: The Italian Job? That's right - three iconic and fully electric models were purpose-built to speed through the LA underground, without polluting it with exhaust fumes. Now, that's responsible film-making!
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.8=Here's something you probably agree with: sustainability starts at the top of an organization. Sometimes literally, like in the case of our plant in Swindon England. The 8,000 square meter roof of the facility is used to collect rainwater. This water is then used for a variety of purposes, from cleaning the plant, to watering its green areas, but also for flushing the toilets. That last one might make you grin, but it's also an important, albeit small contribution to greater sustainability in the automotive industry.
customPersonality.funFact.success.planet.9=Did you know: Just like all the other BMW Group plants, the MINI Plant in Oxford England gets 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.0=You probably know we've made more than just cars, but did you know we once made a surfboard? Teaming up with Californian manufacturer Channel Islands, we created the world's first MINI-designed surfboard, which featured a wider outline and low rocker for agility and speed. But you could also customize its design to your heart's content, with colors like Chili Red, and black rally stripes. You could really ride your MINI on land, and then, your MINI on the waves.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.10=Did you know that we once made a Rolls-Royce? Well, almost. The Mini Cooper S Inspired by Goodwood was a special edition, that we made in collaboration with Rolls-Royce, which featured detailing specific to the luxury car maker inside and out. Such as Walnut Burr wood trim and Cornsilk leather seats. Only 1,000 units of the Mini Cooper S Inspired by Goodwood were produced, making it a rare, exclusive, and pretty expensive addition to any collection.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.11=Were you aware of some of the big strides our cars have made quite recently? When the first modern MINI Countryman was launched at the Geneva Motorshow in 2010, it was not only the first MINI with four doors and a large tailgate, as well as a variable interior that offered space for up to four occupants. It was also the first production MINI that was longer than 4 meters. We all grow up sooner or later.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.12=Do you know what makes a special MINI especially British? How about naming it the Countryman Park Lane Edition - after a most distinguished part of London? Good start. Then what if we gave it an Earl Grey metallic body finish, and Oak Red roof and exterior mirror caps? Now that's more like it.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.13=Can you guess which production MINI was the first two-seater in our model range after the MINI relaunched in 2001? If you think about what kind of cars usually leave out the rear seats, the answer might reveal itself to you: it was the 2011 MINI Coup\u00E9, the sporty, helmet-roofed MINI with a silhouette that looked as sleek and speedy as any MINI ever.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.14=Do you remember that between 2011 and 2015 we produced the strictly two-seater MINI Coup\u00E9? The sporty flat car sits up to 52 millimeters lower than the hatchback MINI of the time. While it had only two seats, the passengers could use it for a variety of purposes: <break strength="strong"/> it has an extended stowage and loading capacity behind the driver and passenger seats; <break strength="medium"/> a large, variable-use luggage area; <break strength="medium"/> and a wide and extremely high-opening tailgate that makes loading easier. A car for those who like easy living.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.15=Were you aware that when we released the MINI Coup\u00E9 in 2011, it didn't only stand out because of its flat silhouette and innovative "helmet roof", but also because at that point <break strength="medium"/> it produced the best performance stats ever recorded by a volume-produced MINI. Which was just as well, as the car was designed with maximum driving fun in mind, and to give the super-compact sports car class a shot in the arm. And it sure did.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.16=Since the MINI brands relaunch at the turn of the Millenium, we've made a number of cars that all aimed to excite people in different ways. Case in point: When we introduced the MINI Coup\u00E9 in 2011, it was absolutely focused on providing unparalleled driving pleasure to the two people it could seat. It had agility unmatched in the small car segment, with a chassis set-up, weight distribution, and aerodynamic properties - including an active rear spoiler that optimizes airflow at higher speeds - focused on delivering optimum performance, and could be ordered with our then-strongest engines.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.17=If you think about which brand could create a compact yet comfortable caravan for two people, equipped with a twin-ring gas stove, a fridge, a sink, a water tank, and even a solar module, your first guess probably wouldn't be MINI. But it should be, as the 2013 MINI Cowley caravan is proof that we can give you a luxurious overnight solution, and a real head-turner. Weighing just under 300 kg, the Cowley ensured that MINI driving fun can still be enjoyed while towing.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.18=Do you fit comfortably in your MINI? We're only asking because size has always been a large part of MINI. The original car was just over 3 meters long, while the relaunched MINI was larger at about 3.6 meters. However, in 2008 we crossed the 4 meter barrier with the MINI Crossover Concept. This car had many special features, not least of which was the three-dimensional central instrument panel, called the MINI Center Globe. And what happened to the Crossover Concept? It went on to become the MINI Countryman.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.19=Here is something that might shock you. The MINI Electric Concept, the direct forerunner of our first electric production car from 2017, was not just progressive with its drivetrain, but had some neat 3D printed parts as well. Its aerodynamic inlays, parts of the simulated air intakes, were all made using 3D printing, not just to show that we could, but to prove that the method could be functional and stylish as well. And did we succeed? Yes, yes we did.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.1=You might have heard that all MINIs from 2030 onwards will be fully electric. That also includes the performance focused John Cooper Works models. Actually, there has already been an electric JCW model, as a kind of teaser. The MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired by JCW <break strength="medium"/> served as a safety car for the FIA Formula E Championship for a couple of seasons. A proof of concept that has us buzzing for the future.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.20=What would you think a MINI aimed at "high-society" would look like? How about Lounge Leather seats in Dark Truffle, with light blue piping and a stainless steel pedal? Or how about 17-inch Double Cross light-alloy wheels with a Union Jack flag pattern, and an exclusive metallic body color called "Iced Chocolate"? That's the sort of classiness the Special Edition MINI Convertible Highgate - named after a particularly exclusive part of London - brought to the table. Classy. Swanky. MINI.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.21=How would you celebrate winning the Dakar Rally? What if you won it twice in a row? We did it the best way we know, with a special celebratory edition in tribute to the winning French duo of St\u00E9phane Peterhansel and Jean-Paul Cottret. Only 11 units of this exclusive model were produced and sold exclusively in France, reflecting Peterhansel's 11 Dakar wins.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.22=Did you know that in 1959 - the same year Alec Issigonis presented the first Mini - John Cooper's team won its first Formula-One World Championship? Cooper would then go on to create some of the most important racing Minis, as well as making the "Cooper" name legendary. So it was no surprise that for the 50th anniversary, we created a limited edition of only 250 units. The "MINI John Cooper Works World Championship 50" had a host of unique features, including completely new suspension technology, and could go from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.23=Do you remember that the MINI Countryman once had a more sporty, three-doored cousin? The MINI Paceman has a distinctive design, with a sloping roofline, a longer hood, and a sporty profile that set it apart from other MINI models. It also sits closer to the road and is fractionally lighter than the Countryman of the same generation, while the suspension has been retuned to deliver more responsive handling. It's for those who need speed and momentum, but space as well.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.24=Were you aware that in 2011 we were the first to try our hands at a premium Sports Activity Coupe, also called an <say-as interpret-as="spell-out">SAC</say-as>, in the small car segment? The MINI Paceman Concept was a three-doored, sportier version of the MINI Countryman. The concept would go on to become the MINI Paceman, which was manufactured in the 2010s.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.25=At MINI we enjoy creating special cars,  just to see if we can, and the MINI Paceman Adventure was no exception. This pickup-like vehicle was created as part of the BMW apprentice program and transformed the MINI Paceman, a small crossover SUV, into a pickup with off-road tires, a light bar on the roof, and a small cargo bed. The new suspension and snorkel air intake made it perfect for rugged terrain.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.26=Cast your mind way back to 1998: Titanic is ruling the cinema, Sex and the City is a new hit show, and Apple just released the iMac G3, a groundbreaking and colorful all-in-one desktop computer. But in our opinion, they all pale in comparison to the fact that the legendary Paul Smith designed a limited edition MINI painted in his favorite shade of blue? Then, about 24 years later, he returned to the car and made it part of the MINI Recharged project. The initiative turns classic Minis fully electric, and allows for these classic Minis to be relevant even today. Sir Alec Issigonis, creator of the first Mini, would be proud.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.27=Would you believe that it took until 2011 for us to create our first open-top two-seater? But what we made was pretty cool. The MINI Roadster was the first premium sports car of its kind in the small car segment. The two-seater was equipped with a  manually opening soft-top roof, roll-over bars in polished stainless steel, and an active rear spoiler extending automatically at 80 km/h. Big personality <break strength="strong"/> in a small car.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.28=Did you know that for the 2012 London Olympics <break strength="medium"/> we created a special and very British version of our extra small Rocketman Concept? The car, which is almost as small as the original 1959 Mini, was painted inside and out in the colors of the UK flag, while its dashboard listed all previous Olympic cities. It also had a teenie-tiny basketball court with miniature players on the center console between the driver and front passenger.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.29=The MINI is not a large car, but the classic Mini was even smaller. Which is why in 2011 we created a MINI concept car that was almost as small as the original 1959 Mini? The Rocketman Concept has some interesting features, to make the small car use its limited space: it has wide-opening doors with double-hinge joints - making getting in a breeze -  while the lightweight seats can be arranged in a variety of different positions from two to four passengers. Talk about a clever use of space.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.2=I bet you know that motorsports is not just about engineering? You probably did. What really captures public imagination are the stories born out of exceptional people driving their exceptional cars. And we have a lot of those stories, as can be seen in <break strength="medium"/> "The Faith of a Few", a short film celebrating John Cooper Works Motorsport heritage , <break strength="medium"/> won two golden, and two silver lions at the Cannes Lions advertising festival.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.30=Here's something interesting: if we were to create a car as small as the original 1959 Mini, we've already laid the groundwork with the 2011 MINI Rocketman Concept, as it has features a tiny but premium car should have. It has a transparent roof to increase the sense of space, and a flexible luggage compartment, which includes a tailgate that extends out of the body in the form of a drawer, allowing you to carry more - much more.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.31=Sometimes you have to go back to basics to see further ahead. Good advice <break strength="medium"/> which we took to heart with 2011 MINI Rocketman Concept. With a length of 3.419 meters, it's only a few centimeters longer than the original Mini from 1959, which required us to really redefine what "A Clever use of Space" means, and previewed some things that would become standard in a few years, like our then-new infotainment system.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.32=Did you know that when MINI and the legendary designer Paul Smith made the MINI Strip, by taking out all unnecessary parts of a MINI Cooper SE, they still managed to make the interior stand out. They purposefully omitted all trim parts except for the dashboard, topper pad, and parcel shelf. The exposed basic materials gave it a bare but beautiful look. With a basic dashboard made of up only one part, as they even omitted a traditional infotainment system, they had the driver's smartphone functioning as a media control center.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.33=Have you heard of the MINI Strip? Its a car stripped of all unnecessary parts from a MINI Cooper SE, with the aim of making it as sustainable as possible. It features 3D-printed recycled plastic parts and a Perspex panoramic roof. It has visible screws on the add-on parts, inspired by the passion for bicycles of its legendary co-creator, designer Paul Smith. The unfinished body with its grinding marks and transparent paint give it a unique and sustainable aesthetic.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.34=How did the 2021 MINI STRIP achieve absolute minimalism and high-level functionality? Take the steering wheel: reduced to its essential functions, it's wrapped in road bike style handlebar tape. It has visible screws and a simple mesh cover that shows the airbag behind it. The door panels are made from mesh, revealing their structure, while the pull handles are made from climbing rope. The door openers are in milled aluminum, housed in the cork door shoulders. Interestingly, the more basic and exposed the design, the more pleasing it is.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.35=What do you call a MINI Cooper SE with no colored paint? A masterpiece. MINI and Paul Smith teamed up to create a minimalist car with a fresh and unconventional appeal. The three-door MINI Strip features a deliberately unfinished exterior, protected by a thin film of transparent paint. Grinding marks on the galvanized steel panels were intentionally left intact, giving the car a unique, "perfectly imperfect" aesthetic.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.36=What do you get when you combine sustainability with style? The MINI STRIP, of course! This stripped-back concept car boasts a minimalist interior design that features recycled and environmentally-friendly materials. The knitted fabric seats are completely recyclable, and the floor mats are made from recycled rubber. The dashboard topper pad, door shoulders, and parcel shelf are made from eco-friendly cork that's both firm and soft to the touch. Not only do these materials look good, but they also enhance the car's interior acoustics.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.37=What do you get when you take the "less is more" ethos to its limit? The MINI STRIP! This one-of-a-kind car, created with the legendary designer Paul Smith, premiered in London in August 2021. The car is a testament to sustainable automotive design, with a focus on simplicity, transparency, and sustainability. As the name suggests, we took a MINI Cooper SE and reduced it to its structural essentials. Then, only the absolutely necessary elements were implemented and put in the car - but in more sustainable forms.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.38=What do you think you'll be using your car for in the future? We at MINI see the future of the car not just as a tool to get you from A to B, but as a personal home, which extends into a public area. Mobility will not be about taking you to a place but taking you on a journey of great experiences. And nothing proves this mindset more than the MINI Vision Urbanaut, a concept car that aimed to appeal to all the senses of its passengers, from visual delights to specific fragrances.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.39=Did you know that the MINI Vision Urbanaut - a futuristic concept car from 2021 - was not only designed to offer maximum space on the smallest possible footprint, but also to be environmentally sustainable? Apart from being fully electric, the car had a reduced number of components to avoid unnecessary use of materials. Plus, the vehicle was designed to create an urban space for people when it's not in use, increasing its usability. Fun fact: the dashboard can even turn into a daybed!
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.3=If you've ever ridden in a MINI John Cooper Works model, you know that they are built to do exceptional things. But even so, you probably didn't think that one of the record breaking stunts it has to its name was one performed by a heavily modified JCW Countryman, when it achieved a completely unassisted backflip from a 26 foot high static ramp at a ski resort in France. <lang xml:lang="fr-FR">Mon Dieu</lang> indeed.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.40=What do you get when you cross a car with a sanctuary? The MINI Vision Urbanaut! MINI's 2021 concept car offered an all-new interpretation of mobility. But it's more than just a means of transportation; it's a personal urban oasis that embodies the future of mobility, with three modes - Chill, Wanderlust and Vibe - that used fragrances, sound and ambient lighting to enrich the mood of the chosen moment. But that was just one of the ways the car aimed to bring the future just a little bit closer.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.41=What happens when you mix MINI's motorsporting heritage with a futuristic vision? You get the car that almost became the new MINI. The Mini ACV 30 started its life as a design proposal in the nineties by Adrian van Hooydonk, now head of design at BMW, as one of several concepts intended to become the new MINI. While that was not to be, it was developed further and became an impressive 30th-anniversary tribute to the iconic Mini Cooper and its motorsport heritage.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.42=Have you heard of the Pat Moss Edition of the MINI 3-door and MINI 5-door? These limited edition cars celebrate the racing history of the British premium brand, and the sporting careers of Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom, who won the Tulip Rally in May 1962. The vehicle features exclusive designs with a graphic element based on the outline of the famous Dutch flower and the MINI logo. Classy and sweet.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.43=Were you aware that the classic Mini was just as much loved for its versatility as any other factor? Well, the relaunched MINI inherited some of that flexibility. In 2014 we revealed the MINI <lang xml:lang="it-IT">Superleggera</lang> Vision concept car, in collaboration with Italian coachbuilder Touring <lang xml:lang="it-IT">Superleggera</lang>. Combining British charm with Italian craftsmanship, it features a sleek, two-seater roadster design with clean lines and a distinctive front grille, while still being 100 per cent MINI. <prosody rate="slow">Ciao <break strength="medium"/> small Bella</prosody> .
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.44=Do you like the outdoors? What about camping? If you love those things and MINI as well, you can go camping without ever having to put your tent on the ground? Available for the MINI Countryman, we've created stylish roof-top tents, which can easily fit onto the MINI and provide sleeping space for two people. Perfect for those impromptu camping trips.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.45=How would you celebrate the Olympics coming to your home country? If you're us, you create some truly amazing special edition cars that reflect the location and the occasion. That's how MINI Baker Street and MINI Bayswater were created for the 2012 Olympic games. The MINI Baker Street embodies the youthful, fresh and innovative trend-setting style of London and MINI, while the MINI Bayswater is all about sporting verve and agile handling.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.46=Did you know that the MINI Countryman was preceded by a much wilder concept car: The MINI Beachcomber Concept? It had no roof, and no doors, and no B-Pillar, as well as a unique grater pattern grille. The car didn't just show how different a MINI could be, but was also evocative of the cult-favorite jeep-like beach buggy, the Mini Moke.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.47=Here's something you probably know: by 2030 <break strength="strong"/> all MINI models will be fully electric? But you might not realize that such a significant journey didn't start just yesterday of course. In 2003, we were the first manufacturer of premium automobiles to deploy a fleet of about 500 all-electric vehicles for private use in daily traffic. These MINI E's were the forerunners of the first fully electric MINI, the Cooper S E.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.48=You've probably seen the MINI Cooper SE, our first fully electric model, that made its debut in 2019. Maybe you even own one, which could easily be possible, as shortly after its launch it quickly became one of our brands most liked models. However, the car's journey started a decade prior with the development of the Mini E. <break strength="strong"/> This fully-electric vehicle underwent a two-year test program with a fleet of 500 vehicles in markets worldwide, to see how people would actually use such a vehicle in their day-to-day lives.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.49=Here's a bit of soccer trivia: MINI scored big with football fans at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with the MINI Paceman GoalCooper. based on the MINI John Cooper Works Paceman, was the perfect car of choice for those looking to make more than Mexican waves. It had a multi-colored Brazilian exterior, astro turf floor mats, stadium-like lighting, and a miniature table football set, that let users connect to other drivers. Was it fun? Yes, that was the Gooooooooooallll!
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.4=There are two types of people in the world. Those who love a John Cooper Works MINI, and those who have never sat in one. And its easy to see why its so well-liked, as it's designed to bring the most exciting driving experience - usually reserved for track cars - and tailor it for everyday use.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.5=You probably know that Mini cars have been produced - basically continuously - since 1959. Interestingly it took exactly sixty years for the ten millionth MINI to roll off the production line at the plant in Oxford. Coincidentally, that car was a MINI "60 Years Edition" anniversary model. Don't you love it when things come together?
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.6=Did you realize that the MINI Clubvan was the world's first premium compact delivery van? With two seats, five doors, and a closed-off load area, it offered enhanced functionality for urban commercial users. Based on the MINI Clubman, it was the first modern MINI classed as a commercial vehicle. It didn't come out of nowhere either, as it had historic roots tracing back to the Morris Mini Van from the 1960s.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.7=Can you imagine living in a MINI? Well, in 2013 we created the world's smallest luxury camper van, that you would probably love to spend a few nights in. The MINI Clubman Camper <break strength="medium"/> was a versatile home on wheels, complete with a sleeping berth, kitchenette, and even a television. Plus, its glass roof could be opened for ventilation or star-gazing, and it even had an integrated hand-held shower, as well as an auxiliary heater. This tiny camper had everything you need for a perfect road trip adventure.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.8=Have you ever looked at the MINI Clubman and thought <break strength="strong"/> "Hey, <break strength="strong"/> this could be turned into a van!" So have we! That's why we created the MINI Clubvan Concept in 2012, combining practicality and style. With a closed-off load area behind the front seats, opaque rear side windows, and maximum load capacity, it was aimed at inner-city commercial use, such as in the fleet of fashion designers, art gallery owners, event caterers, or others with bulky equipment. Talk about stylish and sensible.
customPersonality.funFact.success.products.9=Can a car become a classic in just four years? If it's a MINI, then probably. Take the first generation of the new MINI Convertible that appeared in 2004. In only four years, the cars sold more than 164,000 units, with the most enthusiastic markets being sunny UK and Ireland. Perhaps if the car is fun enough, then the weather doesn't matter so much.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.0=Even though you are currently enjoying the most beloved part of what MINI has to offer, the brand is about more than the car. We are focused on urban mobility-and-living in all its forms. That is why in 2016 we launched URBAN-X, following the same creative spirit that has pioneered all our ventures. The program supports start-ups that want to reimagine city life: helping them become more sustainable, liveable, and loveable.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.10=Have you heard of Urban-X, our startup accelerator program focused on startups bettering all aspects of urban living? Multimer is one of such companies. They specialize in transforming complex urban data into actionable insights for cities and urban planners. By utilizing advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms, Multimer helps cities make informed decisions regarding transportation, infrastructure, and public services. Their innovative approach empowers urban stakeholders to optimize resources, enhance efficiency, and create smarter, more sustainable cities. And those are the kinds of cities we'd like to live in.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.11=At our start-up accelerator program, Urban-X, we believe in harnessing the power of technology to create smarter cities, and Numina is a company that exemplifies this mission. They specialize in deploying intelligent sensors to collect real-time data on urban environments. This enables cities to understand and optimize the use of public spaces, improve traffic flow, and enhance safety. Using valuable insights to empower city planners and policymakers to make data-driven decisions for more efficient and livable urban landscapes? Now that is something we can, and did <break strength="medium"/> get behind.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.12=Have you heard about Urban-X, our start-up accelerator program? It supports companies that make urban living more sustainable. And that's often about bringing communities together. Which is what OneRoof does. Their communication platform facilitates building-wide connections, enabling residents to form interest groups, organize events, and exchange goods and services. From clothing swaps to board game nights, residents can enhance connectivity, support each other, and combat loneliness as well. Because why shouldn't a community start with those who live closest to you.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.13=URBAN-X, the start-up accelerator program founded by MINI focuses on bettering all aspects of urban living. And one of our startups, Qucit is a great example. Their innovative technology harnesses data to optimize urban services and enhance livability. By analyzing various factors such as transportation, parking, and air quality, Qucit provides actionable insights to improve urban planning and decision-making. Their solutions aim to empower cities to tackle congestion, reduce pollution, and create more sustainable and enjoyable living spaces. And admirable dream, which we share.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.14=Have you heard about Urban-X, our start-up accelerator program? It helps us support companies that are trying to make more sustainable, livable urban environments. Companies such as Singularity, a real-time carbon intelligence platform that provides a suite of innovative products, developer APIs, and intelligent tools to help companies build the future of decarbonization solutions. Singularly clever.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.15=We at MINI believe in revolutionizing urban mobility, and Upshift is a startup that shares our vision. Supported by Urban-X, our startup accelerator program, they aim to reshape the car rental industry. They offer a unique subscription-based service that allows members to access a wide range of vehicles. They aim to reduce the need for car ownership and promote sustainable urban mobility. They're paving the way for a more efficient and eco-friendly urban transportation system, and we hope that they get there.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.1=MINI is more than a car. Our brand is focused on mobility and urbanity in all aspects. That is why we created our start-up accelerator, URBAN-X. We've already helped over 70 start-ups through an immersive 20 week program, helping achieve the optimal <break strength="weak"/> "product-market fit". We're focusing on start-ups that make cities more lovable and liveable: everything from transportation to construction, or even food waste.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.2=Did you know that the BMW and MINI Driving Experience expanded its training courses to include safety training for people with physical disabilities? Specially converted BMW and MINI models, such as the MINI John Cooper Works, allow for comfortable steering, and additional hand controls for acceleration and braking. With practical driving exercises ranging from braking to drifting, participants gain increased driving pleasure and confidence in different traffic situations. It's a real win-win-win situation.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.3=Do you like innovation? Of course you do, you're driving a MINI. We also love those people, companies, and startups who challenge our preconceived notions of what's possible. And we especially love those who devote themselves to noble pursuits, like tackling climate change. Farmshelf, a company that we've supported through our URBAN-X startup program since Day 1, builds smart indoor farms that make it easy to grow produce where you live, work, and eat. All in a bookcase-sized unit. How cool is that?
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.4=You probably know that we at MINI care about sustainability, but you probably didn't think that our efforts go way beyond mobility. Urban-X, the start-up accelerator program founded by MINI focuses on bettering all aspects of urban living, even things such as online shopping. Because while it can be quick and comfortable, the shipping of goods produces massive amounts of waste. That is where the URBAN-X supported start-up, Limeloop comes in. They've made it their mission to use reusable packaging and smart technology to make shopping more sustainable across the globe.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.5=Have you heard about Urban-X, our start-up accelerator program? It helps us support companies that are trying to make more sustainable, livable urban environments. Start-ups such as Aquagenuity, which helps individuals, corporations and smart cities track water quality in real time, and monitor water's impact on health and sustainability. They can provide a snapshot of what's in the water, as well as notifications and recommendations for changes in water quality. Using data analytics and proprietary algorithms, Aquagenuity helps users predict and prevent water-related health crises and mitigate revenue losses. And to that, <break strength="medium"/> we raise our glasses.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.6=Are you familiar with our start-up accelerator program called Urban-X? It aims to make urban living more sustainable and livable. Which is why we support start-ups like Climatebase. They're a leading platform and community for climate employment. They're on a mission to accelerate climate solutions by mobilizing the world's talent to work on them, by connecting mission-driven talent to high-impact jobs at organizations working to address climate change. A verticalized social platform for climate action? We're sold.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.7=Have you heard of our start-up accelerator program called Urban-X? It aims to make urban living more sustainable and livable. And that sometimes means looking higher than street level. The Urban-X supported <prosody rate="slow"> DirtSat </prosody> utilizes an asset that most never think of: everyday rooftops! Urban rooftop farms can boost building energy efficiency, absorb stormwater, and reduce the heat island effect, while providing additional revenue to building owners, presenting a $38B opportunity in the US. Sometimes, making cities more resilient and sustainable in the face of climate change can start from the top down.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.8=Did you know our start-up accelerator program called Urban-X supports efforts that might seem counterintuitive to a brand like MINI? Take Dollaride, who help organizations plan, launch, and manage their own commuter transit services, including long-term and short-term routes. They provide the digital infrastructure to effectively close gaps in local transit - all while reducing carbon emissions and bolstering clean mobility options. Even though it seems like something a car brand wouldn't support, MINI knows the future of urban mobility is bigger than simple private ownership.
customPersonality.funFact.success.progress.9=Have you ever come across our start-up accelerator program called Urban-X? It aims to make urban living more sustainable and livable. And one way to do that is through greater diversity. The Urban-X supported Gentian use the latest in machine learning technology and remote sensing data to help communities assess and create more ecodiversity, from rooftops to rural areas. This can help with everything from making homes more resilient to extreme weather, cooling cities, identifying pests or diseases, and improving energy output. All-in-all very promising.
